This means you have to know where the risk is, but focus, in the right order, on just enough optimization to get the business to a place where that risk can be quantified and understood.

Let’s say that the company in our example is concerned about whether the product is good enough to make people use it consistently. This is usually the right place to focus for SaaS companies, because they seldom get a second chance to make a first impression, and need users to keep coming back. In other words, they care about stickiness. The company will, of course, need some amount of conversion (and therefore some amount of attention), but only enough to test stickiness.

In other words, they care about stickiness. The company will, of course, need some amount of conversion (and therefore some amount of attention), but only enough to test stickiness. Those initial users could be acquired by word of mouth, or by direct selling, or by engaging with users on social networks. There’s probably no need for a full-blown, automated marketing campaign at this stage.


**1965 (highlight)**

Customer acquisition payback is a great example of a single number that encompasses many things, since it rolls up marketing efficiency, customer revenue, cash flow, and churn rate.


**1968 (highlight)**

Before focusing on sophisticated financial metrics, start with revenue. But don’t ignore costs, because profitability is the real key to growth.


**1969 (highlight)**

You know it’s time to scale when your paid engine is humming along nicely, which happens when the CAC is a small fraction of the CLV—a sure sign you’re getting a good return on your investment.


**1978 (highlight)**

The ultimate metric for engagement is daily use. How many of your customers use your product on a daily basis? If your product isn’t a daily use app, establishing a minimum baseline of engagement takes longer, and the time it takes to iterate through a cycle of learning is longer. It’s also hard to demonstrate enough value, quickly enough, to keep people from churning. Habits are hard to form—and with any new product, you’re creating new habits, which you want to do as quickly and intensely as possible.


**1986 (highlight)**

Investors likely agree with the company’s focus on engagement, since they’re giving the company deep cash reserves to keep growing. In other words, conversion isn’t Evernote’s main concern right now, although once it improves engagement that’s absolutely what it will concentrate on.[31


**1992 (highlight)**

you bring an early version of your product to the market, test its usage, and look for where it’s got the highest engagement among your customers. If there’s a subsection of users who are hooked on your product—your early adopters—figure out what’s common to them, refocus on their needs, and grow from there. Claim your beachhead. It will allow you to iterate much more quickly on a highly engaged segment of the market.


**2011 (highlight)**

To find ways you might improve things, segment users who do what you want from those who don’t, and identify ways in which they’re different. Do the engaged users all live in the same city? Do all users who eventually become loyal contributors learn about you from one social network? Are the users who successfully invite friends all under 30 years old? If you find a concentration of desirable behavior in one segment, you can then target it.


**2018 (highlight)**

A data-driven approach to measuring engagement should show you not only how sticky your product or service is, but also who stuck and whether your efforts are paying off.


**2023 (highlight)**

you should pick a timespan for all your metrics and stick to it in order to make comparing them easier.


**2025 (highlight)**

While churn might seem like a simple metric, there are a number of complications that can make it misleading, particularly for companies that have a highly variable growth rate. Unpaid users “churn” by cancelling their accounts or simply not coming back; paid users churn by cancelling their accounts, stopping their payments, or reverting to an unpaid version. We recommend defining an inactive user as someone who hasn’t logged in within 90 days (or less). At that point, they’ve churned out;


**2031 (highlight)**

As Shopify data scientist Steven H. Noble[32] explains in a detailed blog post,[33] the simple formula for churn is:


**2102 (highlight)**

Ultimately, the math gets really complex. There are two ways to simplify it. The first is to measure churn by cohort, so you’re comparing new to churned users based on when they first became users. The second way is really, really simple, which is why we like it: measure churn each day. The shorter the time period you measure, the less that changes during that specific period will distort things.


**2135 (highlight)**

Just because SaaS is a recurring service doesn’t mean it needs to be priced that way. If your product is ephemeral—like a transient job posting—it might be better to offer more transactional pricing. Pricing is a tricky beast. You need to test different price points qualitatively (by getting feedback from customers) and quantitatively. Don’t assume a low price is the answer; customers might not attribute enough value to your offering. And remember that everything, including price, makes up the “product” you’re offering.


**2141 (highlight)**

In a SaaS model, most of the complexity comes from two things: the promotional approach you choose, and pricing tiers.


**2149 (highlight)**

For the most part, we’ve talked about SaaS as a service provided to customers on a monthly subscription. But there are other revenue models that can work as well. While a subscription model lends itself to more predictive financial planning and less volatile revenue numbers, it doesn’t always fit the value proposition, or how customers expect to pay.


**2152 (highlight)**

Key Takeaways While freemium gets a lot of visibility, it’s actually a sales tactic, and one you need to use carefully. In SaaS, churn is everything. If you can build a group of loyal users faster than they erode, you’ll thrive. You need to measure user engagement long before the users become customers, and measure customer activity long before they vanish, to stay ahead of the game. Many people equate SaaS models with subscription, but you can monetize on-demand software in many other ways, sometimes to great effect.


**2241 (highlight)**

For mobile developers, the dynamics of an app store matter more than almost anything else when it comes to achieving significant traction. Being showcased on the home page of Apple’s App Store routinely yields a hundredfold increase in traffic.[


**2259 (highlight)**

ARPU is simply the revenue you’ve made, divided by the number of active users or players you have. If you inflate the number of active players to make yourself look good, you’ll reduce the ARPU, so this metric forces you to draw a realistic line in the sand about what “engaged” means.


**2289 (highlight)**

Treat your paying users as a separate customer base and track their behavior, churn, and revenue separately from your nonpaying ones.


**2296 (highlight)**

Track churn at 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month, because users leave at different times for different reasons. After one day it could be you have a lousy tutorial or just aren’t hooking users. After a week it could be that your game isn’t “deep enough,” and after a month it could be poor update planning. Knowing when users churn gives you an indication of why they’re churning and what you can try in order to keep them longer.


**2444 (highlight)**

Our sports site is taking advantage of four distinct media monetization models. To do this, it’s had to set aside a considerable amount of its screen real estate to accommodate a sponsor, a display banner, two click-through ads, and an affiliate ad for a book. Of course, this undermines the site’s quality and leaves less room for valuable content that will keep visitors coming back. Striking a balance between commercial screen space and valuable content is tricky.


**2451 (highlight)**

Many of the vanity metrics we’ve warned you about earlier are actually relevant to media sites, since those sites make money from popularity.


**2467 (highlight)**

You can calculate audience churn on a media site by looking at the change in unique visitors in a specific month and the number of new visitors that month (see Table 11-6).


**2499 (highlight)**

If you have the ability to test different layouts—one with fewer ads, for example—across visitor segments, you can determine the level of “churn tax” you’re paying for having commercial content on the page. Then you can balance this against the revenue you’re earning from advertising.


**2539 (highlight)**

The rate advertising networks will pay you for an ad depends on your content and the going rate for a particular search term or keyword. For a straight-up media site, the ad rate is driven by the topic of your site and the content you publish. For a social network, the demographics of your audience drive ad rates.


**2622 (highlight)**

UGC is about the amount of good content versus bad, and the percentage of users who are lurkers versus creators. This is an engagement funnel,[43] similar to the traditional conversion funnels of an e-commerce model—only instead of moving prospects toward buying, you’re constantly trying to move your user population to higher and higher levels of engagement, turning lurkers into voters, voters into commenters, and so on.


**2628 (highlight)**

Revenue often comes from advertising or donations, but it’s incidental to the core business of engaging users.


**2655 (highlight)**

UGC site is successful when its visitors become regulars. As we’ve seen with SaaS churn, we look at recency to understand this—that is, when was the last time someone came back to the site? One quick way to measure this is the day-to-week ratio: how many of today’s visitors were here earlier in the week? It’s an indicator of whether people are returning on a regular basis, even if users don’t create an account.


**2675 (highlight)**

The rate of content creation and the rate of enrollment matter a lot at the outset. Later, the question becomes whether good content is rising to the top, and whether people are commenting on it—signs that your user base cares about the discussion and is building a community.


**2958 (highlight)**

Early on, a marketplace can grow its inventory by hand, using decidedly low-tech approaches. Do things that don’t scale.


**2963 (highlight)**

Start with the minimum marketplace that proves you have demand, supply, and a desire for buyers and sellers to transact. Then find ways of making money from that activity. The metrics you track will depend on transaction size, frequency, and other unique characteristics of the business. But the fundamentals are the same: revenue from transactions.


**2970 (highlight)**

You need to pick which side of the market you’re going to “seed.” If you want to seed the seller side, you might crawl Craigslist and approach console owners to see if they have inventory, encouraging them to list items. If you want to seed the buyer side, you might set up a forum for nostalgic game players, bringing them together and inviting them from social sites.


**2970 (highlight)**

You need to pick which side of the market you’re going to “seed.” If you want to seed the seller side, you might crawl Craigslist and approach console owners to see if they have inventory, encouraging them to list items. If you want to seed the buyer side, you might set up a forum for nostalgic game players, bringing them together and inviting them from social sites. You could create an artificial inventory by selling consoles to start with, and then gradually adding inventory from others. Car-service provider Uber overcame the chicken-and-egg problem in new markets by simply buying up available towncars: when the company launched in Seattle, it paid drivers $30 an hour to drive passengers around, and switched to a commission model only once it had sufficient demand to make it worthwhile for the drivers. The company created supply. On the other hand, if you want to seed the buyer side, you probably need to pick something for which you can command an initial inventory, then purchase some; or you might take orders with a promise of fulfilling them later, knowing you have access to that inventory. Amazon, for example, started selling books, which allowed it to streamline its order, search, and logistics processes. Then it could offer a broader range of its own goods. Eventually, with access to many buyers and their search patterns, Amazon became a marketplace for goods from many other suppliers. Salesforce.com created a CRM product, and then created an app exchange ecosystem where third-party developers could sell software to existing customers. With respect to their marketplace offerings, both companies first created demand.


**2982 (highlight)**

The health of their chicken-and-egg-defeating strategy was a critical metric: For Uber, this meant measuring how much drivers would be making on a commission basis, as well as the inventory and the time it took a driver to pick up a customer. When those metrics were sustainable (with a reasonable margin of error), it was time to switch from the “artificial” market of paid drivers to the “sustainable” two-sided marketplace of commissions.


**2988 (highlight)**

The first step of a two-sided marketplace—and the first thing to measure—is your ability to create an inventory (supply) or an audience (demand).


**2991 (highlight)**

Josh Breinlinger, a venture capitalist at Sigma West who previously ran marketing at labor marketplace oDesk, breaks up the key marketplace metrics into three categories: buyer activity, seller activity, and transactions. “I almost always recommend modeling the buyer side as your primary focus, and then you model supply, more in the sense of total inventory,” he says. “It’s easy to find people that want to make money; it’s much harder to find people that want to spend money.”


**3029 (highlight)**

But this data looks a lot like vanity metrics. What we really care about are engaged buyers who’ve made a purchase. Drawing a line in the sand, we decide someone is a buyer if she’s made at least one purchase, and that a buyer is engaged if she’s searched for something in the last 30 days


**3200 (highlight)**

Inventory growth The rate at which sellers are adding inventory—such as new listings—as well as completeness of those listings.


**3202 (highlight)**

Search effectiveness What buyers are searching for, and whether it matches the inventory you’re building.


**3233 (highlight)**

In many two-sided markets, searches are the primary way in which buyers find sellers. You need to track the number of searches that return no results—this is a lost sales opportunity.


**3255 (highlight)**

By looking at the most common search terms that yield nothing, you’ll find out what your buyers are after. A dominant search term—say, “Nintendo”—might suggest a category you could add to the site to make navigation easier, or a keyword campaign you could undertake to attract more buyers. You’ll want to know what the most lucrative search terms are, too, because that tells you what kind of seller you should attract to the site.


**3444 (highlight)**

At the outset, you’re spending your time discovering what’s important to people and being empathetic to their problems. You’re searching through listening. You’re digging for opportunity through caring about others. Right now, your job isn’t to prove you’re smart, or that you’ve found a solution. Your job is to get inside someone else’s head. That means discovering and validating a problem and then finding out whether your proposed solution to that problem is likely to work.

**4080 (highlight)**

As you’re building your bare-minimum product—just enough functionality to test the risks you’ve identified in the Empathy stage—you’ll continue to gather feedback (in the form of surveys) and acquire early adopters (through a beta enrollment site, social media, and other forms of teasing). In this way, by the time you launch the MVP you’ll have a critical mass of testers and early adopters eager to give you feedback. You’re farming test subjects. Your OMTM at this point is enrollments, social reach, and other indicators that you’ll be able to drive actual users to your MVP so you can learn and iterate quickly.

**4099 (highlight)**

The MVP has to generate the value you’ve promised to users and customers. If it’s too shallow, people will be disinterested and disappointed. If it’s too bloated, people will be confused and frustrated. In both cases, you’ll fail.


**4115 (highlight)**

The real analytical work starts the minute you develop and launch an MVP, because every interaction between a customer and the MVP results in data you can analyze. For starters, you need to pick the OMTM.


**4118 (highlight)**

Everything you build into the initial MVP should relate to and impact the OMTM. And the line in the sand has to be clearly drawn.


**4119 (highlight)**

At this stage, metrics around user acquisition are irrelevant. You don’t need hundreds of thousands of users to prove if something is working or not. You don’t even need thousands.


**4130 (highlight)**

total focus is necessary in order to make genuine progress.


**4131 (highlight)**

The most important metrics will be around engagement. Are people using the product? How are they using the product? Are they using all of the product or only pieces of it? Is their usage and behavior as expected or different?


**4133 (highlight)**

No feature should be built without a corresponding metric on usage and engagement.


**4136 (highlight)**

you need to be sure you’re actually adding value. Let’s say you launch a new SaaS product, and you assume that if someone doesn’t use it in 30 days, he’s churned. That means it’ll be 30 days before you know your churn rate. That’s much too long. Customers always churn, but if you’re not writing them off quickly, you may think you have more engagement than you really do. Even if initial engagement is strong, you need to measure whether you’re delivering value. You might, for example, look at the time between visits. Is it the same? Or does it gradually drop off?


**4142 (highlight)**

You should be speaking with users and customers throughout the MVP process. Now that they have a product in their hands, you can learn a great deal from them.


**4146 (highlight)**

Be Prepared to Kill Features It’s incredibly hard to do, but it can make a huge difference. If a feature isn’t being used, or it’s not creating value through its use, get rid of it and see what happens. Once you’ve removed a feature, continue to measure engagement and usage with existing users. Did it make a difference? If nobody minds, you’ve cleaned things up. If the existing users protest, you may need to revisit your decision. And if a new cohort of users—who’d never seen the feature before it was removed—start asking for it, they may represent a new segment with different needs than your existing user base. The narrowing of your focus and value proposition through the elimination of features should have an impact on how customers respond.


**4176 (highlight)**

Analytics Lessons Learned Building a more advanced purchasing system that sacrificed first-purchase simplicity for long-term ease of repeat purchases seemed like a good idea, but it was premature. This early in the company’s life, the question was “Will people buy prints?” and not “Will we have loyal buyers?” The feature the team had built was de-risking the wrong question. Always know what risk you’re eliminating, and then design the minimum functionality to measure whether you’ve overcome it.


**4182 (highlight)**

Your goal is to identify a need you can solve in a way people will pay money for at scale. Analytics is how you measure your way from your initial idea to the realization of that goal.


**4237 (highlight)**

MVP Stickiness The focus now is squarely on retention and engagement. You can look at daily, weekly, and/or monthly active users; how long it takes someone to become inactive; how many inactive users can be reactivated when sent an email; and which features engaged users spend time with, and which they ignore. Segment these metrics by cohort to see if your changes convince additional users to behave differently. Did users who signed up in February stick around longer than those who joined in January?


**4246 (highlight)**

Your top priority is to build a core set of features that gets used regularly and successfully, even by a small group of initial users.


**4248 (highlight)**

Ultimately, you need to prove two things before you can move on to the Virality stage: Are people using the product as you expected? If they aren’t, maybe you should switch to that new use case or market, as PayPal did when it changed from PalmPilot to web-based payment or when Autodesk stopped making desktop automation and instead focused on design tools. Are people getting enough value out of it? They may like it, but if they won’t pay, click ads, or invite their friends, you may not have a business. Don’t drive new traffic until you know you can turn that extra attention into engagement. When you know users keep coming back, it’s time to grow your user base.


**4257 (highlight)**

Iterating on your MVP is difficult, tedious work. It’s methodical. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like innovation. Iterations are evolutionary; pivots are revolutionary. This is one of the reasons founders get frustrated and decide instead to pivot repeatedly in the hopes that something will accidentally engage their users. Resist that temptation.


**4260 (highlight)**

If a new feature doesn’t significantly improve the One Metric That Matters, remove it.


**4347 (highlight)**

consider innovation when prioritizing feature development; generally, the easiest things to do rarely have a big impact. You’re still in the Stickiness stage, trying to find the right product. Changing a submit button from red to blue may result in a good jump in signup conversions (a classic A/B test), but it’s probably not going to turn your business from a failure into a giant success; it’s also easy for others to copy. It’s better to make big bets, swing for the fences, try more radical experiments,


**4354 (highlight)**

User actions speak louder than words. Aim for a genuinely testable hypothesis for every feature you build, and you’ll have a much better chance of quickly validating success or failure. Simply tracking how popular various features are within the application will reveal what’s working and what’s not. Looking at what feature a user was using before he hit “undo” or the back button will pinpoint possible problem areas.

In this section, the founders re-list the problems and include hypothesized solutions. These solutions are hypothesized because we don’t know if they’ll work. These are experiments that the founders will run in the next week.


**4568 (highlight)**

What’s the problem, how do you propose to fix it, and how will you know if you succeeded? That’s the core of the Problem-Solution Canvas.


**4601 (highlight)**

The key at this stage is engagement, which is measured by the time spent interacting with you, the rate at which people return, and so on. You might track revenue or virality, but they aren’t your focus yet.

Rely on cohort analysis to measure the impact of your continuous improvements as you optimize the stickiness of your product.


**4652 (highlight)**

Premature growth burns money and time, and will quickly kill your startup.


**4676 (highlight)**

Finally, there’s natural word of mouth. Harder to track, it’s also extremely effective, because it amounts to an endorsement by a trusted advisor. You can see some of this activity by simply monitoring blogs and social platforms for mentions of your startup—and when you see one it’s a good idea to engage with the endorser, find out what made him share your product or service, and try to turn that into a repeatable, sustainable part of the viral growth strategy.


**4720 (highlight)**

While the most fundamental of these is the viral coefficient, you can also measure the volume of invites sent by a user, or the time it takes her to invite someone.


**4720 (highlight)**

While the most fundamental of these is the viral coefficient, you can also measure the volume of invites sent by a user, or the time it takes her to invite someone. For companies selling to an enterprise market, where click-to-invite virality isn’t the norm, there are other metrics that might work better. One is the net promoter score, which simply asks how likely a user is to tell his friends about your product and compares the number of strong advocates to those who are unwilling to recommend


**4729 (highlight)**

That doesn’t mean you should ignore virality; rather, it means you need to treat it as a force multiplier that will make your paid marketing initiatives more successful. That’s why the Virality stage comes before the Revenue and Scale stages: you want to get the biggest bang for your marketing buck, and to do so, you need to optimize your viral engines first.


**4763 (highlight)**

Focusing on a metric like viral coefficient may be too high level; instead, look for the actions within your product that drive virality


**4776 (highlight)**

Growth Hacking Most startups won’t survive on gradual growth alone. It’s just too slow. If you want to grow, you need an unfair advantage. You need to tweak the future. You need a hack. Growth hacking is an increasingly popular term for data-driven guerilla marketing. It relies on a deep understanding of how parts of the business are related, and how tweaks to one aspect of a customer’s experience impact others. It involves: Finding a metric you can measure early in a user’s lifecycle (e.g., number of friends a user invites) through experimentation, or, if you have the data, an analysis of what good users have in common Understanding how that metric is correlated to a critical business goal (e.g., long-term engagement) Building predictions of that goal (e.g., how many engaged users you’ll have in 90 days) based on where the early metric is today Modifying the user experience today in order to improve the business goal tomorrow (e.g., suggesting people a user might know), assuming today’s metric is causing a change in tomorrow’s goal The key to the growth hacking process is the early metric, (which is also known as a leading indicator—something you know today that predicts tomorrow). While this seems relatively straightforward, finding a good leading indicator, and experimenting to determine how it affects the future of the company, is hard work. It’s also how many of today’s break-out entrepreneurs drove their growth.


**4809 (highlight)**

Leading indicators tend to relate to social engagement (links to friends), content creation (posts, shares, likes), or return frequency (days since last visit, time on site, pages per visit).

**4812 (highlight)**

The indicator should come early in the user’s lifecycle or conversion funnel. This is a simple numbers game: if you look at something that happens on a user’s first day, you’ll have data points for every user,


**4937 (highlight)**

The goal in the Revenue stage is to turn your focus from proving your idea is right to proving you can make money in a scalable, consistent, self-sustaining way.


**4978 (highlight)**

every CEO needs to make his business model as straightforward as possible, particularly to outsiders, so it’s painfully obvious why the venture will yield revenues.


**4987 (highlight)**

Startup CEOs seeking venture capital would do well to remember the penny machine. It’s a good way to ensure you’re thinking like a venture capitalist. Every time your pitch strays from the simplicity of this meeting, it’s a warning sign that you need to go back and tighten it up.


**5013 (highlight)**

Recall Sergio Zyman’s definition of marketing (more stuff to more people for more money more often more efficiently) using. In the Revenue stage, you need to figure out which “more” increases your revenues per engaged customer the most: If you’re dependent on physical, per-transaction costs (like direct sales, shipping products to a buyer, or signing up merchants), then more efficiently will figure prominently on either the supply or demand side of your business model. If you’ve found a high viral coefficient, then more people makes sense, because you’ve got a strong force multiplier added to every dollar you pour into customer acquisition. If you’ve got a loyal, returning set of customers who buy from you every time, then more often makes sense, and you’re going to emphasize getting them to come back more frequently. If you’ve got a one-time, big-ticket transaction, then more money will help a lot, because you’ve got only one chance to extract revenue from the customer and need to leave as little money as possible on the table. If you’re a subscription model, and you’re fighting churn, then upselling customers to higher-capacity packages with broader features is your best way of growing existing revenues, so you’ll spend a lot of time on more stuff.


**5046 (highlight)**

Balancing acquisition, revenue, and cash flow is at the core of running many business models, particularly those that rely on subscription revenue and paying to gain customers. As you play with the numbers to strike that balance, there are really four variables you work on: The money in the bank at the outset (i.e., your investment) The amount of money spent on customer acquisition each month The revenue you bring in from users The rate of churn from users Get the math right. Take too much, and you dilute your ownership; take too little, and you run out of cash simply because your users pay you over time but you have to acquire them up front.


**5094 (highlight)**

Recognize that being able to make money is an inherent assumption of most business models, but that to de-risk the model you need to test it early. Be prepared to radically change, or even shut down, parts of your company in your quest for revenue.

Lincoln Murphy does a great job of laying out the math on addressable market size in a presentation entitled The Reality of Freemium in SaaS.[72] One of his big conclusions: without a huge potential market and a number of other factors, freemium just doesn’t work.

As you’re validating your problem and solution, ask yourself whether there are enough people who really care enough to sustain a 5% growth rate—but don’t strive for that rate of growth at the expense of really understanding your customers and building a meaningful solution.


**5712 (highlight)**

but a good rule of thumb is that your acquisition cost should be less than a third of the total value a customer brings you over her lifetime.


**5716 (highlight)**

“In my experience, churn has the biggest impact on CLV, and unfortunately, churn is a lagging indicator,” says Zach Nies. He suggests offering only month-to-month subscription plans initially in order to get a better picture of true churn early on.


**5730 (highlight)**

Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, don’t spend more than a third of the money you expect to gain from a customer (and the customers she invites downstream) on acquiring that customer.


**5753 (highlight)**

There’s no “typical” virality for startups. If virality is below 1, it’s helping lower your customer acquisition cost. If it’s above 1, you’ll grow. And if you’re over 0.75, things are pretty good. Try to build inherent virality into the product, and track it against your business model. Treat artificial virality the same way you would customer acquisition, and segment it by the value of the new users it brings in.

Open and click-through rates will vary significantly, but a well-run campaign should hit a 20–30% open rate and over 5% click-through.

Study after study has proven that fast sites do better across nearly every metric that matters, from time on site to conversion to shopping cart size.[90] Yet many web startups treat page-load time as an afterthought.

Some people who try a SaaS product are just curious; others are seriously evaluating the tool. They show different behaviors, and can be treated as separate segments based on their activities and how much time they invest in exploring the product.

Totango’s data shows that for most SaaS providers, 20% of visitors are serious evaluators, 20% are casual evaluators, and 60% are simply curious. The best approach is to tailor marketing to users based on their activity. You need to convince serious evaluators that you’re the right choice, and convince the casual evaluators that they should become more serious. Identify serious prospects by usage analytics and focus sales resources on those users. Combining usage analytics (finding out who’s serious) with an open door (no paywall) yields the best results.

According to Totango’s research, the best approach is to not put up a credit card paywall to try the service, but to segment users into three groups—then market to the active ones, nurture the casual ones, and don’t waste time on those who are just curious bystanders (or at best, get them to tell friends who might be real prospects about you).

if you’re charging every customer, you can still experiment with pricing in the form of promotions, discounts, and time-limited offers. Each of these is a hypothesis suitable for testing across cohorts (if you use time-limited offers) or A/B comparisons (if you offer different pricing to different visitors).

marketplaces, and UGC sites) The best SaaS sites or applications usually have churn ranging from 1.5% to 3% a month. For other sites, it’ll vary depending on how you define “disengaged.” Mark MacLeod, Partner at Real Ventures, says that you need to get below a 5% monthly churn rate before you know you’ve got a business that’s ready to scale.

As mobile applications get more complex, their file sizes increase. This poses a risk for developers, though; consumers on slower connections may abandon a download if it takes too long.

Alexandre makes a point of using the phrase “on the portal” to refer to the initial download from Apple’s App Store or Android app stores. He says, “Some developers will work around the limitation by having a small app on the Google or Apple portals, and this app will then download additional content ‘transparently’ from the developer’s servers while you play.”

There’s no clear number, but if a content generation function (such as uploading photos) is core to the use of your application, optimize it until all your users can do it, and track error conditions carefully to find out what’s causing the problem.

There’s a surprisingly consistent rule of thumb for social networks and UGC websites. Across many companies we polled, the average time on site per day seemed to be 17 minutes.

this would be a great indicator of stickyness! what additionnal features can we provide to app creator to get to that numbe of 15min/day?

Jakob Nielsen once observed that in an online population, 90% of people lurk, 9% contribute intermittently, and 1% are heavy contributors.[

Expect to spend a significant amount of time and money fighting spam as you become more popular. Start measuring what’s good and bad, and which users are good at flagging bad content, early on—the key to effective algorithms is a body of data to train them. Content quality is a leading indicator of user satisfaction, so watch for a decline in quality and deal with it before it alienates your community.

There is another reason analytics matter to marketplaces. Sellers seldom have the sophistication to analyze pricing, the effectiveness of their pictures, or what copy sells best. As the marketplace owner, you can help them with this analysis. In fact, you can do it better than they can, because you have access to the aggregate data from all sellers on the

because you want to help your sellers, you should selectively share analytical data with them that will make them better at selling.

Top 10 lists are a good way to start understanding how your marketplace is working. Run some queries of KPIs like revenue and number of transactions according to product segments: Who are your top 10 buyers? Who are your top 10 sellers? What products or categories generate the majority of your revenues? What price ranges, times of day, and days of week experience peak sales? It might seem simple, but making lists of the top 10 segments or categories, and looking at what’s changing, will give you qualitative insights

Nearly any optimization effort has diminishing returns. Making a website load in 1 second instead of 10 is fairly easy; making it load in 100 milliseconds instead of 1 second is much harder. Ten milliseconds is nearly impossible. Eventually, it’s not worth the effort, and that’s true of many attempts to improve something. That shouldn’t be discouraging. It’s actually useful, because it means that as you approach a local maximum, you can plot your results over time and see an asymptote. In other words, the rate at which your efforts are producing diminishing results can suggest a baseline, and tell you it’s time to move to a different metric that matters.
