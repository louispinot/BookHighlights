#﻿Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works

It’s time to lay your Lean Canvases side by side and prioritize which models to start with. Your objective is to find a model with a big enough market you can reach with customers who need your product that you can build a business around.


**1036 (highlight)**

Customer pain level (Problem) Prioritize customer segments that you believe will need your product the most.


**1038 (highlight)**

If you have an easier path to one segment of customers over others, take that into consideration.


**1040 (highlight)**

it will get you out of the building faster and speed up your learning.


**1069 (highlight)**

The “right” advisors, on the other hand, can help you identify risks on the “total plan” and help you to further refine and/or outright eliminate some models.

guidelines for running business model interviews:


**1079 (highlight)**

tool of choice is an incremental build of the Lean Canvas delivered on an iPad (or paper). I start with a blank canvas and incrementally reveal parts of the business model as I walk through it.


**1083 (highlight)**

usually takes me three to five minutes to walk through my model; then I shut up and listen.


**1085 (highlight)**

Ask specific questions. I specifically want to know: What do they consider to be the riskiest aspect of this plan? Have they overcome similar risks? How? How would they go about testing these risks? Are there other people I should speak with?

**1178 (highlight)**

Challenge yourself to find the simplest thing you can do to test a hypothesis.


**1179 (highlight)**

Once you truly understand what’s riskiest about your product, it’s often possible to build something other than the product to test it.


**1197 (highlight)**

They started with a single customer and manually built these weekly plans to validate their riskiest assumptions first. Their objective was learning over efficiency.


**1211 (highlight)**

first statement is a hypothesis that cannot be proven wrong because the expected outcome of driving early adopters is not measurable.


**1216 (highlight)**

A formula for crafting a falsifiable hypothesis is: Falsifiable Hypothesis = [Specific Repeatable Action] will [Expected Measurable Outcome]

methodically run staged experiments that visit every box on the canvas. Your business model is not


**1331 (highlight)**

While surveys are bad at supporting initial learning, they can be quite effective at verifying what you learn from customer interviews.


**1363 (highlight)**

if a customer declares a problem as a must-have, probe deeper. Ask him how he solves the problem today. If he is doing nothing and still getting by, the problem may not be as acute.


**1368 (highlight)**

Stick to a script.


**1369 (highlight)**

bind the conversation around specific learning goals.


**1373 (highlight)**

first objective will be to home in on the defining attributes of early adopters,


**1374 (highlight)**

It’s better to start with a broader sweep of initial prospects at this stage


**1393 (highlight)**

interviews typically run between 20 and 30 minutes, without feeling rushed.


**1401 (highlight)**

I recommend spending five minutes immediately following an interview to document the results while your thoughts are fresh.


**1432 (highlight)**

Create an email list from the teaser page.


**1478 (highlight)**

which customers are most affected (early adopters), how they solve these problems today (existing alternatives), and what you would offer that is different (UVP).


**1479 (highlight)**

Problem interviews to validate your understanding of the problem and then moving on to the Solution interviews.


**1482 (highlight)**

even in these cases there are underlying problems, albeit more desire- than pain-driven. As in the previous case, I agree that these don’t need to be explicitly tested. Instead first spend time understanding your audience (early adopter) and then look for smaller, faster ways to test your solution — for example, build a teaser


**1497 (highlight)**

In The Four Steps to the Epiphany, Steve Blank points out the importance of in-depth customer interviews, which he terms “Customer Discovery.”


**1506 (highlight)**

What You Need to Learn The Problem interview is all about validating your hypotheses around the “problem-customer segment” pair. In the Problem interview, you are specifically looking to tackle the following risks: Product risk: What are you solving? (Problem) How do customers rank the top three problems? Market risk: Who is the competition? (Existing Alternatives) How do customers solve these problems today? Customer risk: Who has the pain? (Customer Segments) Is this a viable customer segment?

We are currently working on a photo and video sharing service designed for parents. I got


**1557 (note)**

very specific about the project right from the start


**1565 (highlight)**

Ask some introductory questions to collect basic demographics that you believe will drive how you segment and qualify your early adopters:


**1571 (highlight)**

Illustrate the top problems with a story: Great, thanks. So, let me tell you about the problems we are tackling. Once we had kids, we found ourselves taking a lot more photos than before, and especially


**1581 (highlight)**

State the top one to three problems and ask your prospects to rank them:


**1587 (highlight)**

So that you don’t bias the ranking, frequently reorder the Problem list.


**1590 (highlight)**

heart of the interview. The best script here is “no script.” Go through each problem in turn. Ask the interviewees how they address the problem today. Then sit back and listen.


**1590 (highlight)**

heart of the interview. The best script here is “no script.”


**1592 (highlight)**

Let them go into as much detail as they wish. Ask follow-up questions, but don’t lead them or try to convince them of the merits of a problem


**1594 (highlight)**

judge their body language and tone to get a sense of how they’d rate the problem: “must-have,” “nice to have,” or “don’t need.”


**1595 (highlight)**

If they offer up new problems along the way, explore them the same way:


**1599 (highlight)**

This section is invaluable both for understanding the problems and for confirming the prospects’ earlier problem ranking. Sometimes people unknowingly lie


**1603 (highlight)**

Hook and Ask)


**1608 (highlight)**

ask for permission to follow up. Your goal is to establish a continuous feedback


**1609 (highlight)**

ask the interviewees for referrals to other potential prospects:


**1619 (highlight)**

I recommended earlier that you run the interview with one other person whenever possible to keep the results objective. Each of you should independently fill out the form first. Then have a debriefing session later where you compare notes


**1659 (highlight)**

you are scheduling interviews at a good pace, you should be talking to 10 to 15 people a week. Don’t change the script during the week. Rather, debrief at the end of each week to review that week’s batch of interviews, summarize your learning, and make any adjustments to your script.


**1661 (highlight)**

based on the type of hypotheses you are testing and the strength of the signal


**1662 (highlight)**

adjust the script and customer demographic along the way so that you can incrementally get stronger and more consistent positive signals


**1663 (highlight)**

Start to home in on early adopters. Look for identifying demographics among the responses that were most favorable


**1666 (highlight)**

strong “don’t need” signal across the board, drop that problem from the script. Similarly, if you discover a new “must-have” problem, add it to the script.


**1675 (highlight)**

Once you start getting a sense of who the early adopters are, start identifying the path to reach more people like them. We’ll start testing these channels in Chapter 8


**1678 (highlight)**

You are done when you have interviewed at least 10 people and you: Can identify the demographics of an early adopter Have a must-have problem Can describe how customers solve this problem today


**1696 (highlight)**

One that repeatedly stood out was the fear of losing all their photos and videos (currently only on their desktops) due to a lack of backups. We started testing this in subsequent Problem interviews and it resonated strongly with the other parents, too.


**1711 (highlight)**

Eighty percent of parents expressed some form of frustration with their existing solutions, but 60% of them were currently getting by with a “free alternative”: email. This posed a challenge, as we would need to justify the value of CloudFire against something that was free,


**1716 (highlight)**

Based on these insights, we updated our canvas with the changes shown in Figure 7-6


**1727 (highlight)**

Armed with a prioritized problem list and an understanding of existing alternatives, you are now ready to formulate and test a solution.


**1731 (highlight)**

What is the minimum feature set needed to launch?


**1733 (highlight)**

Will customers pay for a solution? What price will they bear?


**1740 (highlight)**

build just enough of the solution (or a proxy, like screenshots, a prototype, etc.) that you can put in front of customers for the purpose of measuring their reaction and further defining the requirements for your minimum viable product


**1825 (highlight)**

Prizing Oren Klaff discusses this framing technique in his book, Pitch Anything (McGraw-Hill). He describes how, in most pitches, the presenter plays the role of a jester entertaining in a royal courtyard (of customers). Rather than trying to impress, position yourself to be the prize.


**1900 (highlight)**

If you don’t sense a strong problem resonance, don’t continue with the Solution interview, but rather use the Problem interview script to learn more about how the prospects solve these problems today.


**1904 (highlight)**

Go through each problem in turn and illustrate how you solve it using the supporting demo.


**1907 (highlight)**

We are trying to prioritize what to finish and release first and would like to ask you a few more questions: What part of the demo resonated with you the most? Which could you live without? Are there any additional features you think are missing?


**203 (highlight)**

find a plan that works before running out of resources.


**205 (highlight)**

systematic process for rigorously stress-testing a Plan A. That is what Running Lean is about.


**215 (highlight)**

This is the fundamental dilemma described by Steve Blank in The Four Steps to the Epiphany, in which he offers a process for building a continuous customer feedback loop throughout the product development cycle that he terms Customer Development.


**236 (highlight)**

the parallel process of building a continuous feedback loop with customers throughout the product development cycle.


**239 (highlight)**

Get out of the building.


**248 (highlight)**

Specifically, our objective is maximizing learning (about customers) per unit time.


**259 (highlight)**

Right action, right time. Startups are inherently chaotic, but at any given point in time, there are only a few key actions that matter. You need to just focus on those and ignore the rest.


**312 (highlight)**

I knew customers held the answers but didn’t know when or how to fully engage them. That’s exactly what Customer Development and Lean Startup were attempting to address.


**373 (highlight)**

Lean Startup strives to uphold a strong vision with facts, not faith.


**373 (highlight)**

It is important to accept that your initial vision is built largely on untested assumptions (or hypotheses). Running Lean helps you systematically

It is important to accept that your initial vision is built largely on untested assumptions (or hypotheses). Running Lean helps you systematically test and refine that initial vision.


**393 (highlight)**

you can outline multiple business models on a canvas in one afternoon.


**395 (highlight)**

Concise The canvas forces you to pick your words carefully and get to the point.


**411 (highlight)**

spending a disproportionate amount of time talking about their solution and not enough time talking about the other components of the business model. Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems. —


**423 (highlight)**

Lean Canvas helps deconstruct your business model into nine distinct subparts that are then systematically tested, in order of highest to lowest risk.


**430 (highlight)**

“tackling the riskiest parts first.” Not coincidentally, for most products, the solution isn’t what’s riskiest.


**440 (highlight)**

Stage 1: Problem/Solution Fit Key question: Do I have a problem worth solving?


**447 (highlight)**

During this stage, we attempt to answer these questions using a combination of qualitative customer observation and interviewing techniques that we’ll cover in great detail Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.[


**449 (highlight)**

From there you derive the minimum feature set to address the right set of problems, which is also known as the minimum viable product (MVP).


**488 (highlight)**

consider this for our go-to-US strategy


**498 (highlight)**

Instead, your first goal should be to establish just enough of a runway to allow you to start testing and validating your business model with customers. While not the same thing, bootstrapping and Lean Startups are quite complementary. Both cover techniques for building low-burn startups by eliminating waste through the maximization of existing resources before expending effort on the acquisition of new or external resources. Bootstrapping + Lean Startup = Low-Burn Startup

called these readers


**551 (highlight)**

understand this book’s unique value proposition in relation to existing alternatives.


**635 (highlight)**

Just as rushing to build a solution can lead to waste, so can prematurely picking a customer segment or business model.


**648 (highlight)**

Start by brainstorming the list of possible customers for your product: Distinguish between customers and users. If you have multiple user roles in your product, identify your customers. A customer is someone who pays for your product. A user does not.


**655 (highlight)**

Put everyone on the same canvas at first. If you are building a multisided business, you might find it necessary to outline different problems, channels, and value propositions for each side of the market. I recommend starting with a single canvas first


**660 (highlight)**

the elements of your business model can and will vary greatly by customer segment.


**660 (highlight)**

starting with the top two or three customer segments you feel you understand the best or find most promising.


**678 (highlight)**

Sketch a canvas in one sitting.


**680 (highlight)**

take a snapshot of what’s in your head at this moment in time,


**688 (highlight)**

Think in the present. Business plans try too hard to predict the future,


**690 (highlight)**

Based on your current stage and what you know right now, what are the next sets of hypotheses you need to test to move your product forward?


**696 (highlight)**




**701 (highlight)**

Another way to think about problems is in terms of the jobs customers need done:


**706 (highlight)**

List existing alternatives. Document how you think your early adopters address these problems today.


**729 (highlight)**

Unique Value Proposition: Why you are different and worth buying getting attention.


**733 (highlight)**

First-time visitors spend eight seconds on average on a landing page. Your UVP is their first interaction with your product. Craft a good UVP and they might stay and view the rest of your site. Otherwise, they’ll simply leave.


**736 (highlight)**

hard to get right because you have to distill the essence of your product in a few words that can fit in the headline of your landing page.


**738 (highlight)**

start with a best guess and iterate from there.


**745 (highlight)**

deriving your UVP directly from the number-one problem you are solving.


**795 (highlight)**

not getting carried away with fully defining your solution just yet. Rather, simply sketch out the simplest thing you could possibly build to address each problem. Bind a solution to your problem as late as possible.


**830 (highlight)**

Interviews are a form of outbound channel that are the exception. As we’ll see with the next two points, the return on learning from an interview far exceeds the cost of running an interview.


**835 (highlight)**

But as a learning channel, direct selling is one of the most effective, since you interact face to face with the customer.


**887 (highlight)**

I highly recommend getting a copy of Neil Davidson’s free ebook on software pricing, Don’t Just Roll the Dice.


**889 (highlight)**

alternatives provide reference price anchors against which your offering will be measured.
