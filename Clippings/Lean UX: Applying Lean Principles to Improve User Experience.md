remove waste from our UX design process. We move away from heavily documented handoffs to a process that creates only the design artifacts we need to move the team’s learning forward.

cross-functional collaboration that brings nondesigners into our design process.

Agile refocuses software development on value. It seeks to deliver working software to customers quickly and to adjust regularly to new learning along the way.


**1409 (highlight)**

knowing you’re never more than a few days away from customer feedback has a powerful effect on teams. It takes the pressure away from your decision making because you know that you’re never more than a few days from getting meaningful data from the market.


**1475 (highlight)**

As soon as possible after the research sessions are over — preferably the same day, or at least the following day — gather the team together for a review session. When the team has reassembled, ask everyone to read their findings to each other. An efficient way to do this is to transcribe the notes people read out loud onto index cards or sticky notes, then sort the notes into themes.


**1486 (highlight)**

Park your outliers As tempting as it is to ignore outliers (or try to serve them in your solution), don’t do it. Instead, create a parking lot or backlog for them. As your research progresses over time (remember, you’re doing this every week), you may discover other outliers that match the pattern. Be patient.

In order to maintain a regular cadence of user testing, your team must adopt a “test everything” policy. Whatever is ready on testing day is what goes in front of the users.

policy. Whatever is ready on testing day is what goes in front of the users.


**161 (highlight)**

You need to know — as a team — that you’re not going to get it right the first time and that you’re all working together to iterate your way forward. I want you to gain that confidence, too.

Tim Brown, CEO and president of legendary design firm IDEO, described design thinking as “innovation powered by...direct observation of what people want and need in their lives and what they like or dislike about the way particular products are made, packaged, marketed, sold, and supported...[It’s] a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity.”[


**296 (highlight)**

The assumption in Lean UX is that the initial product designs will be wrong, so the goal should be to find out what’s wrong with them as soon as possible.


**300 (highlight)**

Lean Startup uses a feedback loop called “build-measure-learn” to minimize project risk and gets teams building quickly and learning quickly. Teams build Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and ship them quickly to begin the process of learning as early as possible.


**304 (highlight)**

Lean Startup processes reduce waste by increasing the frequency of contact with real customers, therefore testing and avoiding incorrect market assumptions

should be removed from the team’s process.


**346 (highlight)**

Team resources are limited. The more waste the team can eliminate, the faster they can move. Teams want to work on the right challenges. They want to be effective.


**356 (highlight)**

Continuous discovery is the ongoing process of engaging the customer during the design and development process. This engagement is done through regularly scheduled activities,


**359 (highlight)**

Research is done on frequent and regular schedules. Research involves the entire team.


**376 (highlight)**

Shared understanding is the currency of Lean UX. The more a team collectively understands what it’s doing and why, the less it has to depend on secondhand reports and detailed documents to continue its work.


**384 (highlight)**

Principle: Externalizing Your Work


**397 (highlight)**

Debating ideas is waste. Instead of analyzing potential scenarios, make something and get out of the building with it.


**411 (highlight)**

Finally, as the following anecdote illustrates so beautifully, frequent failures lead to increased mastery of skills.


**419 (highlight)**

Outside observers of the class noted that the highest-quality pots had been made by the “quantity group.” They had spent the entire semester working as quickly as they could to make pots. Sometimes they succeeded, and sometimes they failed. With each iteration, each experiment, they learned. From that learning, they became better able to achieve the end goal: making high-quality clay pots.

Arti, the designer, goes back to her desk to start detailing the design they’ve sketched. Mark, the front-end developer, starts building the page — he uses premade components from the living style guide the team has put in place, so he doesn’t need to wait for Arti before getting the basic pieces in place. Rick opens the project’s wiki and begins to document the decisions the team has made about the application behavior.

This is the day-to-day rhythm of Lean UX: a team working collaboratively, iteratively, and in parallel, with few handoffs, minimal deliverables, and a focus on working software and market feedback.

This is the day-to-day rhythm of Lean UX: a team working collaboratively, iteratively, and in parallel, with few handoffs, minimal deliverables, and a focus on working software and market feedback. In this section, you’ll see how it’s done. In the previous section, I showed you


**491 (highlight)**

Declaring your assumptions allows your team to create a common starting point. By doing this as a team, you give every team member — designer and nondesigner alike — the opportunity to voice his or her opinion on how best to solve the problem.


**589 (highlight)**

We believe that [doing this/building this feature/creating this experience] for [these people/personas] will achieve [this outcome]. We will know this is true when we see [this market feedback, quantitative measure, or qualitative insight].


**631 (highlight)**

Together with your team, look at the problem you are trying to solve. You probably have a few high-level outcomes you are hoping to achieve (e.g., increasing signups, increasing usage, etc.). Consider how you can break down these high-level outcomes into smaller parts. What behaviors will predict greater usage: more visitors to the site? Greater click-through on email marketing? Increasing number of items in the shopping cart? Sometimes it’s helpful to run a team brainstorm to create a list of individual outcomes that, taken together, you believe will predict the larger outcome you seek.


**651 (highlight)**

In Lean UX, we change the order of operations in the persona process. When creating personas in this approach, we start with assumptions and then do research to validate our assumptions. Instead of spending months in the field interviewing people, we spend a few hours creating proto-personas. Proto-personas are our best guess as to who is using (or will use) our product and why.


**669 (highlight)**

We like to sketch proto-personas on paper using a hand-drawn quadrant, as in Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6 (start by folding a sheet of paper into four boxes). The top-left quadrant holds a rough sketch of the persona and his or her name and role. The top-right box holds basic demographic information. Try to focus on demographic information that predicts a specific type of behavior. For example, there may be cases in which the persona’s age is totally irrelevant yet their access to a specific device, such as an iPhone, will completely change the way they interact with your product. Figure 3-5. Blank persona template The bottom half of the proto-persona is where we put the meat of the information. The bottom-left quadrant contains the user’s needs and frustration with the current product or situation, the specific pain points your product is trying to solve, and/or the opportunity you’re trying to address. The bottom-right quadrant contains potential solutions for those needs. You’ll use the bottom-right quadrant to capture feature and solution ideas.


**682 (highlight)**

As with the other elements of the hypothesis statement, we like to start the persona creation process with a brainstorm.


**684 (highlight)**

Once the brainstorming is complete, the team should narrow down the ideas to an initial set of three or four personas they believe are most likely to be the target audience. Try to differentiate the personas around needs and roles rather than by demographic.


**694 (highlight)**

we like to create feature lists by brainstorming them as a team. We’re looking for features we think will drive customer behavior in the desired direction. Have each team member write each idea, using a thick marker, on a sticky note. When time is up, ask everyone to post their notes to the wall and have the group arrange them into themes.

Over the long haul, collaboration yields better results than hero-based design


**741 (highlight)**

designing together increases the design IQ of the entire team.

designing together increases the design IQ of the entire team. It allows every member of the team to articulate his or her ideas.


**743 (highlight)**

It is this shared understanding that is the currency of Lean UX. The more the team collectively understands, the less it has to document in order to move forward.


**750 (highlight)**

In a typical collaborative design session, teams sketch together, critique the work as it emerges, and ultimately converge on a solution that they feel has the greatest chance of success.


**763 (highlight)**

Parallel paths for software development and design are the fastest route to an actual experience.


**793 (highlight)**

Design Studio follows this path: Problem definition and constraints Individual idea generation (diverge) Presentation and critique Iterate and refine (emerge) Team idea generation (converge)


**805 (highlight)**

The first step in Design Studio is to ensure that everyone is aware of the problem you are trying to solve, the assumptions you’ve declared (including personas, as explained elsewhere in this chapter), the hypotheses you’ve generated, and the constraints within which you are working. This step can be anything from a formal presentation with slides to a group discussion,


**864 (highlight)**

There are two basic approaches to creating a style guide: Big bang In this approach, your team takes a limited amount of time (e.g., one to two weeks or sometimes months) away from their current efforts to document all of your product’s UI elements in a style guide. The benefit here is that the style guide gets created in a relatively short amount of time. The negative is that your team is not learning anything new about your product during this time. Slow drip In this approach, your team adds an element to the style guide each time they create or change one for the project. The biggest benefit here is that the team continues to work on the project. However, the drawback is that the style guide is rarely completed and therefore fails to provide some of the efficiencies that a complete one does. Maintaining a Style Guide When planning your style guide, it’s important to plan for maintenance. You’re going to need to create a process and dedicate people to keeping your style guide up to date. Think of a style guide as a living process that you launch and maintain, rather than a static thing you create.


**876 (highlight)**

your goal should be to make it easier to use the style guide than to avoid it. You want to make compliance easy! So plan to dedicate people and time to keeping your style guide current.


**922 (highlight)**

Ajax and jQuery events, buttons — all should be included in the style guide.


**925 (highlight)**

Provide three data points for each interaction design element: What the element looks like Include detail about the minimum and maximum sizes of the element, vertical and horizontal constraints, and any styling demands on the element. Where it’s usually placed on the screen Make it clear if an element should be consistently placed in certain areas of the screen as well as any exceptions that may negate this design pattern. When it should be used It’s imperative that your team knows when to use a drop-down menu rather than a radio button and other factors that would determine the selection of one UI element over another.


**934 (highlight)**

Next, include all visual design elements. Start with the general color palette of your product. Ensure that each primary color is available with hex values as well as complementary and secondary color choices. If certain elements, such as buttons, have different colors based on state, ensure that this information is included. Other elements to include here are logos, headers, footers, grid structures, and typographical choices


**939 (highlight)**

Finally, ensure that copywriting styles are codified as well. Capture the tone of your brand, specific words you will and won’t use, grammatical choices, tolerated (and not tolerated) colloquialisms, along with button language (OK? Yes? Go? etc.) and other navigation language (previous/next, more/less, etc.).


**966 (highlight)**

Your style guide is not just a library or museum for interaction components. It should be a “widget factory” that can produce any interface element on demand.


**967 (highlight)**

As each new element is added to the style guide, make it available for download in whatever formats your team will need. Ensure that not only the code is available but the graphical and wireframe assets as well. Doing so allows every designer to have a full palette of interface elements with which to create prototypes at any given time.


**971 (highlight)**

There are two parts to creating a style guide: Create a table of contents (TOC) — the TOC determines how your style guide will be structured and provides buckets into which you can start dropping design elements. Separate your TOC into interaction design, visual design, copywriting, branding guidelines, accessibility needs, and any other high-level sections that make sense for your business. Populate the content — As mentioned earlier, there are two ways to go about this: the big bang approach and the slow drip.


**981 (highlight)**

Assign an owner to the style guide. That person need not be singlehandedly responsible for the creation of content in the style guide itself, but he or she should be responsible for ensuring the current state of the guide. Your style guide curator should reach out to content creators and ensure that elements are entered as they are created. In essence, this person functions as the editor of the pattern library. It’s a less than enviable position, so consider rotating this role on a regular basis every three months.
