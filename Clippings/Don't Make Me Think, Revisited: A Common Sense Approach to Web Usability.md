#Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability
##Steve Krug
-----------------------------

**1012 (highlight)**

The moral? It’s vital to have sample pages that show the navigation for all the potential levels of the site before you start arguing about the color scheme.


**1016 (highlight)**

because people in L.A. take driving seriously, they have the best street signs I’ve ever seen. In L.A., Street signs are big. When you’re stopped at an intersection, you can read the sign for the next cross street. They’re in the right place—hanging over the street you’re driving on, so all you have to do is glance up.


**1023 (highlight)**

The result? When I’m driving in L.A., I devote less energy and attention to dealing with where I am and more to traffic, conversation, and listening to All Things Considered. I love driving in L.A.


**1024 (highlight)**

Page names are the street signs of the Web. Just as with street signs, when things are going well I may not notice page names at all. But as soon as I start to sense that I may not be headed in the right direction, I need to be able to spot the page name effortlessly so I can get my bearings.


**1028 (highlight)**

Every page needs a name. Just as every corner should have a street sign, every page should have a name. Designers sometimes think, “Well, we’ve highlighted the page name in the navigation. That’s good enough.” It’s a tempting idea because it can save space, and it’s one less element to work into the page layout, but it’s not enough. You need a page name, too.


**1028 (highlight)**

Every page needs a name. Just as every corner should have a street sign, every page should have a name.


**1036 (highlight)**

The name needs to be prominent.


**1039 (highlight)**

The name needs to match what I clicked. Even though nobody ever mentions it, every site makes an implicit social contract with its visitors: The name of the page will match the words I clicked to get there.


**1058 (highlight)**

The most common failing of “You are here” indicators is that they’re too subtle. They need to stand out; if they don’t, they lose their value as visual cues and end up just adding more noise to the page. One way to ensure that they stand out is to apply more than one visual distinction—for instance, a different color and bold text.


**1061 (highlight)**

Too-subtle visual cues are actually a very common problem. Designers love subtle cues, because subtlety is one of the traits of sophisticated design. But Web users are generally in such a hurry that they routinely miss subtle cues.


**1102 (highlight)**

For tabs to work to full effect, the graphics have to create the visual illusion that the active tab is in front of the other tabs. This is the main thing that makes them feel like tabs—even more than the distinctive tab shape.


**1109 (highlight)**

If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation: What site is this? (Site ID) What page am I on? (Page name) What are the major sections of this site? (Sections) What are my options at this level? (Local navigation) Where am I in the scheme of things? (“You are here” indicators) How can I search?


**1123 (highlight)**

The standard needs to be that these elements pop off the page so clearly that it doesn’t matter whether you’re looking closely or not. You want to be relying solely on the overall appearance of things, not the details. Here’s how you perform the trunk test: Step 1: Choose a page anywhere in the site at random, and print it. Step 2: Hold it at arm’s length or squint so you can’t really study it closely. Step 3: As quickly as possible, try to find and circle each of these items: Site ID Page name Sections (Primary navigation) Local navigation “You are here” indicator(s) Search Try it on your own


**1156 (highlight)**

Teases. Like the cover of a magazine, the Home page needs to entice me with hints of the “good stuff” inside.


**1158 (highlight)**

Content promos spotlight the newest, best, or most popular pieces of content, like top stories and hot deals. Feature promos invite me to explore additional sections of the site or try out features.


**1169 (highlight)**

Registration. If the site uses registration, the Home page needs links or text boxes for new users to register and old users to sign in and a way to let me know that I’m signed in (“Welcome back, Steve Krug”).


**1192 (highlight)**

given the tendency of most users to scan down the page just far enough to find an interesting link, the comparatively small amount of space “above the fold” on the Home page is the choice waterfront property, even more fiercely fought over.


**1202 (highlight)**

The one thing you can’t afford to lose in the shuffle—and the thing that most often gets lost—is conveying the big picture. Whenever someone hands me a Home page design to look at, there’s one thing I can almost always count on: They haven’t made it clear enough what the site is.


**1211 (highlight)**

We know now from a very elegant experiment (search for “Attention Web Designers: You Have 50 Milliseconds to Make a Good First Impression!”) that a lot happens as soon as you open a page. For instance, you take a quick look around (in milliseconds) and form a number of general impressions: Does it look good? Is there a lot of content or a little? Are there clear regions of the page? Which ones attract you? The most interesting thing about the experiment was that they showed that these initial impressions tended to be very similar to the impressions people had after they actually had a chance to spend time on the page. In other words, we make snap judgments, but they tend to be a pretty reliable predictor of our more reasoned assessments. This is not to say that our initial understanding of things is always right. In fact, one of the things I’ve seen most often in usability tests is that people form ideas about what things are and how they work which are just wrong. Then they use these first bits of “knowledge” to help interpret everything they see. If their first assumptions are wrong (“This is a site for ____”), they begin to try to force-fit that explanation on to everything they encounter. And if it’s wrong, they’ll end up creating more misinterpretations. If people are lost when they start out, they usually just keep getting...loster. This is why it’s so crucial that you get them off on the right foot, making sure that they’re clear on the big picture.


**1227 (highlight)**




**1239 (highlight)**

Everything on the Home page can contribute to our understanding of what the site is. But there are three important places on the page where we expect to find explicit statements of what the site is about.


**1264 (highlight)**

For most sites, there’s no need to use a lot of space to convey the basic proposition, and messages that take up the entire Home page are usually too much for people to bother absorbing anyway. Keep it short—just long enough to get the point across, and no longer. Don’t feel compelled to mention every great feature,


**1271 (highlight)**

It’s one of the most important things to test. You can’t trust your own judgment about this. You need to show the Home page to people from outside your organization to tell you whether the design is getting this job done because the “main point” is the one thing nobody inside the organization will notice is missing.


**1282 (highlight)**

On a Web site, the tagline appears right below, above, or next to the Site ID. Taglines are a very efficient way to get your message across, because they’re the one place on the page where users most expect to find a concise statement of the site’s purpose.


**1284 (note)**

can use tagline for more emotinal/branding related statemnts than the value proposition


**1288 (highlight)**

Good taglines are just long enough, but not too long. Six to eight words seem to be long enough to convey a full thought, but short enough to absorb easily.


**1291 (highlight)**

Good taglines convey differentiation and a clear benefit. Jakob Nielsen has suggested that a really good tagline is one that no one else in the world could use except you, and I think it’s an excellent way to look at it. Bad taglines sound generic.


**1294 (highlight)**

Bad taglines sound generic.


**1297 (highlight)**

Don’t confuse a tagline with a motto, like “We bring good things to life,” “You’re in good hands,” or “To protect and to serve.” A motto expresses a guiding principle, a goal, or an ideal, but a tagline conveys a value proposition. Mottoes are lofty and reassuring, but if I don’t know what the thing is, a motto isn’t going to tell me.

The relative handful of sites that have already achieved household word status.

**1313 (highlight)**

When I enter a new site, after a quick look around the Home page I should be able to say with confidence: Here’s where to start if I want to search. Here’s where to start if I want to browse.


**1313 (highlight)**

When I enter a new site, after a quick look around the Home page I should be able to say with confidence: Here’s where to start if I want to search. Here’s where to start if I want to browse. Here’s where to start if I want to sample their best stuff.


**1318 (highlight)**

On sites that are built around a step-by-step process (applying for a mortgage, for instance), the entry point for the process should leap out at me. And on sites where I have to register if I’m a new user or sign in if I’m a returning user, the places where I register or sign in should be prominent.


**1346 (highlight)**

Preserving the Home page from promotional overload requires constant vigilance, since it usually happens gradually, with the slow, inexorable addition of just...one...more...thing.


**1362 (highlight)**

Besides wasting time, these arguments create tension and erode respect among team members and can often prevent the team from making critical decisions. Unfortunately, there are several forces at work in most Web teams that make these debates almost inevitable. In this chapter, I’ll describe these forces and explain what I think is the best antidote.


**1411 (highlight)**

The only problem is, there is no Average User. In fact, all of the time I’ve spent watching people use the Web has led me to the opposite conclusion: ALL WEB USERS ARE UNIQUE AND ALL WEB USE IS BASICALLY IDIOSYNCRATIC

**1424 (highlight)**

The point is, it’s not productive to ask questions like “Do most people like pull-down menus?” The right kind of question to ask is “Does this pull-down, with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?” And there’s really only one way to answer that kind of question: testing. You have to use the collective skill, experience, creativity, and common sense of the team to build some version of the thing (even a crude version), then watch some people carefully as they try to figure out what it is and how to use it. There’s no substitute for it.


**1424 (highlight)**

The point is, it’s not productive to ask questions like “Do most people like pull-down menus?” The right kind of question to ask is “Does this pull-down, with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?”


**1475 (highlight)**

If you want a great site, you’ve got to test.


**1475 (highlight)**

If you want a great site, you’ve got to test. After you’ve worked on a site for even a few


**1487 (highlight)**

Testing one user is 100 percent better than testing none. Testing always works, and even the worst test with the wrong user will show you important things you can do to improve your site.


**1495 (highlight)**

Testing one user early in the project is better than testing 50 near the end. Most people assume that testing needs to be a big deal. But if you make it into a big deal, you won’t do it early enough or often enough to get the most out of it. A simple test early—while you still have time to use what you learn from it—is almost always more valuable than an elaborate test later.


**1498 (highlight)**

Part of the conventional wisdom about Web development is that it’s very easy to go in and make changes. The truth is, it’s often not that easy to make changes—especially major changes—to a site once it’s in use. Some percentage of users will resist almost any kind of change, and even apparently simple changes often turn out to have far-reaching effects. Any mistakes you can correct early in the process will save you trouble down the line.


**1524 (highlight)**

I think every Web development team should spend one morning a month doing usability testing.


**1525 (highlight)**

In a morning, you can test three users, then debrief over lunch. That’s it. When you leave the debriefing, the team will have decided what you’re going to fix before the next round of testing, and you’ll be done with testing for the month.3


**1528 (highlight)**

If you’re doing Agile development, you’ll be doing testing more frequently, but the principles are still the same. For instance, you might be testing with two users every two weeks. Creating a fixed schedule and sticking to it is what’s important.


**1536 (highlight)**

It frees you from deciding when to test. You should pick a day of the month—like the third Thursday—and make that your designated testing day.


**1566 (highlight)**

recruiting people who are from your target audience isn’t quite as important as it may seem. For many sites, you can do a lot of your testing with almost anybody. And if you’re just starting to do testing, your site probably has a number of usability flaws that will cause real problems for almost anyone you recruit.


**1571 (highlight)**

RECRUIT LOOSELY AND GRADE ON A CURVE In other words, try to find users who reflect your audience, but don’t get hung up about it. Instead, loosen up your requirements and then make allowances for the differences between your participants and your audience. When somebody has a problem, ask yourself “Would our users have that problem, or was it only a problem because they didn’t know what our users know?”


**1577 (highlight)**

I’m in favor of always using some participants who aren’t from your target audience,


**1587 (highlight)**

There are many places and ways to recruit test participants, like user groups, trade shows, Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, customer forums, a pop-up on your site, or even asking friends and neighbors. If you’re going to do your own recruiting, I recommend that you download the Nielsen Norman Group’s free 147-page report How to Recruit Participants for Usability Studies.4 You don’t have to read it all, but it’s an excellent source of advice. 4 ...at nngroup.com/reports/tips/recruiting. It’s from 2003, but if you factor in 20% inflation for the dollar amounts, it’s all still valid. And did I mention that it’s free? Typical participant incentives for a one-hour test session range from $50 to $100 for “average” Web users to several hundred dollars for busy, highly paid professionals, like cardiologists for instance.


**1599 (highlight)**

To conduct the test, you need a quiet space where you won’t be interrupted (usually either an office or a conference room) with a table or desk and two chairs. And you’ll need a computer with Internet access, a mouse, a keyboard, and a microphone. You’ll be using screen sharing software (like GoToMeeting or WebEx) to allow the team members, stakeholders, and anyone else who’s interested to observe the tests from another room. You should also run screen recording software (like Camtasia from Techsmith) to capture a record of what happens on the screen and what the facilitator and the participant say. You may never refer to it, but it’s good to have in case you want to check something or use a few brief clips as part of a presentation.


**1610 (highlight)**

Other than keeping the participants comfortable and focused on doing the tasks, the facilitator’s main job is to encourage them to think out loud as much as possible. The combination of watching what the participants do and hearing what they’re thinking while they do it is what enables the observers to see the site through someone else’s eyes


**1620 (highlight)**

You’ll need an observation room (usually a conference room), a computer with Internet access and screen sharing software, and a large screen monitor or projector and a pair of external speakers so everyone can see and hear what’s happening in the test room.


**1622 (highlight)**

write down the three most serious usability problems they noticed during that session so they can share them in the debriefing. You can download a form I created for this purpose from my Web site.


**1637 (highlight)**

The tasks you test in a given round will depend partly on what you have available to test. If all you have is a rough sketch, for instance, the task may consist of simply asking them to look at it and tell you what they think it is.


**1644 (highlight)**

Choose enough tasks to fill the available time (about 35 minutes in a one-hour test), keeping in mind that some people will finish them faster than you expect.


**1645 (highlight)**

participants will understand exactly what you want them to do. Include any information that they’ll need but won’t have, like login information if you’re having them use a demo account. For example: You have an existing account with the username delphi21 and the password correcthorsebatterystaple. You’ve always used the same answers to security questions on every site, and you just read that this is a bad idea. Change your answer for this account.


**1649 (highlight)**

You can often get more revealing results if you allow the participants to choose some of the details of the task. It’s much better, for instance, to say “Find a book you want to buy, or a book you bought recently” than “Find a cookbook


**1652 (highlight)**

What happens during the test? You can download the script that I use for testing Web sites (or the slightly different version for testing apps) at rocketsurgerymadeeasy.com. I recommend that you read your “lines” exactly as written, since the wording has been carefully chosen. A typical one-hour test would be broken down something like this: Welcome (4 minutes). You begin by explaining how the test will work so the participant knows what to expect. The questions (2 minutes). Next you ask the participant a few questions about themselves. This helps put them at ease and gives you an idea of how computer-savvy and Web-savvy they are. The Home page tour (3 minutes). Then you open the Home page of the site you’re testing and ask the participant to look around and tell you what they make of it. This will give you an idea of how easy it is to understand your Home page and how much the participant already knows your domain. The tasks (35 minutes). This is the heart of the test: watching the participant try to perform a series of tasks (or in some cases, just one long task). Again, your job is to make sure the participant stays focused on the tasks and keeps thinking aloud. If the participant stops saying what they’re thinking, prompt them by saying—wait for it—“What are you thinking?” (For variety, you can also say things like “What are you looking at?” and “What are you doing now?”) During this part of the test, it’s crucial that you let them work on their own and don’t do or say anything to influence them. Don’t ask them leading questions, and don’t give them any clues or assistance unless they’re hopelessly stuck or extremely frustrated. If they ask for help, just say something like “What would you do if I wasn’t here?” Probing (5 minutes). After the tasks, you can ask the participant questions about anything that happened during the test and any questions that the people in the observation room would like you to ask. Wrapping up (5 minutes). Finally, you thank them for their help, pay them, and show them to the door.


**1799 (highlight)**

While the participant is doing the tasks, I’m careful not to ask leading questions because I don’t want to bias her. But I always save some time at the end specifically to ask probing questions so I can understand more about what happened and why


**1831 (highlight)**

FOCUS RUTHLESSLY ON FIXING THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEMS FIRST


**1831 (highlight)**

Here’s the method I like to use to make sure this happens, but you can do it any way that works for your team:


**1853 (highlight)**

Resist the impulse to add things. When it’s obvious in testing that users aren’t getting something, the team’s first reaction is usually to add something, like an explanation or some instructions. But very often the right solution is to take something (or some things) away that are obscuring the meaning, rather than adding yet another distraction.


**1862 (highlight)**

Ignore “kayak” problems. In any test, you’re likely to see several cases where users will go astray momentarily but manage to get back on track almost immediately without any help.


**1960 (highlight)**

One way to deal with a smaller living space is to leave things out: Create a mobile site that is a subset of the full site. Which, of course, raises a tricky question: Which parts do you leave out?


**1969 (highlight)**

People are just as likely to be using their mobile devices while sitting on the couch at home, and they want (and expect) to be able to do everything. Or at least, everybody wants to do some things, and if you add them all up it amounts to everything. If you’re going to include everything, you have to pay even more attention to prioritizing. Things I want to use in a hurry or frequently should be close at hand. Everything else can be a few taps away, but there should be an obvious path to get to them.


**1969 (highlight)**

**1976 (highlight)**

With small screens it’s inevitable: To see the same amount of information, you’re going to be either tapping or scrolling a lot more. As long as the user continues to feel confident that what they want is further down the screen or behind that link or button, they’ll keep going. Here’s the main thing to remember, though: MANAGING REAL ESTATE CHALLENGES SHOULDN’T BE DONE AT THE COST OF USABILITY3


**1982 (highlight)**

The siren song of one-design-fits-all-screen-sizes has a long history of bright hopes, broken promises, and weary designers and developers. If there are two things I can tell you about scalable design (a/k/a dynamic layout, fluid design, adaptive design, and responsive design), they’re these: It tends to be a lot of work. It’s very hard to do it well.


**1992 (highlight)**

It’s still getting sorted out. This time, the problem has real revenue implications, so there will be technical solutions, but it will take time. In the meantime, here are three suggestions:


**2032 (highlight)**

As a result, many useful interface features that depended on hover are no longer available, like tool tips, buttons that change shape or color to indicate that they’re clickable, and menus that drop down to reveal their contents without forcing you to make a choice.


**2036 (highlight)**

Affordances require visual distinctions. But the recent trend in interface design (which may have waned by the time you read this) has moved in exactly the opposite direction: removing visual distinctions and “flattening” the appearance of interface elements. It looks darned good (to some people, anyway), and it can make screens less cluttered-looking. But at what price? In this case the tradeoff is between a clean, uncluttered look on one hand and providing sufficient visual information so people can perceive affordances on the other.


**2040 (highlight)**

Unfortunately, Flat design has a tendency to take along with it not just the potentially distracting decoration but also the useful information that the more textured elements were conveying.


**2049 (highlight)**

You can do all the Flat design you want (you may have to, it may be forced on you), but make sure you’re using all of the remaining dimensions to compensate for what you lose.


**2060 (highlight)**

Be careful that your responsive design solutions aren’t loading up pages with huge amounts of code and images that are larger than necessary for the user’s screen.


**2084 (highlight)**

Building delight into mobile apps has become increasingly important because the app market is so competitive. Just doing something well isn’t good enough to create a hit; you have to do something incredibly well.


**2086 (highlight)**

Making your app delightful is a fine objective. Just don’t focus so much attention on it that you forget to make it usable, too.


**2087 (highlight)**

Apps need to be learnable


**2126 (highlight)**

Memorability can be a big factor in whether people adopt an app for regular use. Usually when you purchase one, you’ll be willing to spend some time right away figuring out how to use it. But if you have to invest the same effort the next time, it’s unlikely to feel like a satisfying experience.


**2179 (highlight)**

Out of curiosity, I built myself a camera rig by merging a clip from a book light with a Webcam. It weighs almost nothing and captures the audio with its built-in microphone. Mine cost about $30 in parts and took about an hour to make. I’m sure somebody will manufacture something similar—only much better—before long. I’ll put instructions for building one yourself online at rocketsurgerymadeeasy.com. Lightweight webcam + Lightweight clamp and Gooseneck = Brundlefly Attaching a camera to the device creates a very easy-to-follow view. The observers get a stable view of the screen even if the participant is waving it around. I think it solves most of the objections to other mounted-camera solutions: They’re heavy and awkward. It weighs almost nothing and barely changes the way the phone feels in your hand. They’re distracting. It’s very small (smaller than it looks in the photo) and is positioned out of the participant’s line of sight, which is focused on the phone. Nobody wants to attach anything to their phone. Sleds are usually attached to phones with Velcro or double-sided tape. This uses a padded clamp that can’t scratch or mar anything but still grips the device firmly. One limitation of this kind of solution is that it is tethered: It requires a USB extension cable running from the camera to your laptop. But you can buy a long extension inexpensively. The rest of the setup is very straightforward: Connect the Brundlefly to the facilitator’s laptop via USB. Open something like AmCap (on a PC) or QuickTime Player (on a Mac) to display the view from the Brundlefly. The facilitator will watch this view. Share the laptop screen with the observers using screen sharing (GoToMeeting, WebEx, etc.) Run a screen recorder (e.g., Camtasia) on the computer in the observation room. This reduces the burden on the facilitator’s laptop. That’s it.

No matter what the real reason was, they did an outstanding job of depleting my goodwill towards both the airline and their Web site. Their brand—which they spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year polishing—had definitely lost some of its luster for me. Most of this book has been about building clarity into Web sites: making sure that users can understand what it is they’re looking at—and how to use it—without undue effort. Is it clear to people? Do they “get it”? But there’s another important component to usability: doing the right thing—being considerate of the user.


**2240 (highlight)**

I’ve always found it useful to imagine that every time we enter a Web site, we start out with a reservoir of goodwill. Each problem we encounter on the site lowers the level of that reservoir.


**2259 (highlight)**

The reservoir is limited, and if you treat users badly enough and exhaust it there’s a good chance that they’ll leave. But leaving isn’t the only possible negative outcome; they may not be as eager to use your site in the future, or they may think less of your organization and savage you on Facebook or Twitter.


**2278 (highlight)**

Hiding information that I want. The most common things to hide are customer support phone numbers, shipping rates, and prices.


**2290 (highlight)**

Punishing me for not doing things your way. I should never have to think about formatting data: whether or not to put dashes in my Social Security number, spaces in my credit card number, or parentheses in my phone number. Many sites perversely insist on no spaces in credit card numbers, when the spaces actually make it much easier to type the number correctly. Don’t make me jump through hoops just because you don’t want to write a little bit of code.


**2294 (highlight)**

Asking me for information you don’t really need.


**2302 (highlight)**

Your site looks amateurish. You can lose goodwill if your site looks sloppy, disorganized, or unprofessional, like no effort has gone into making it presentable.


**2304 (highlight)**

Note that while people love to make comments about the appearance of sites—especially about whether they like the colors—almost no one is going to leave a site just because it doesn’t look great. (I tell people to ignore all comments that users make about colors during a user test, unless three out of four people use a word like “puke” to describe the color scheme. Then it’s worth rethinking.2)


**2314 (highlight)**

The good news is that even if you make mistakes, it’s possible to restore my goodwill by doing things that convince me that you do have my interests at heart. Most of these are just the flip side of the other list:


**2316 (highlight)**

Know the main things that people want to do on your site and make them obvious and easy.


**2324 (highlight)**

Save me steps wherever you can. For instance, instead of giving me the shipping company’s tracking number for my purchase, put a link in my email receipt that opens their site and submits my tracking number when I click it. (As usual, Amazon was the first site to do this for me.)


**2332 (highlight)**

Know what questions I’m likely to have, and answer them. Frequently Asked Questions lists are enormously valuable, especially if They really are FAQs, not marketing pitches masquerading as FAQs (also known as QWWPWAs: Questions We Wish People Would Ask). You keep them up to date. Customer Service and Technical Support can easily give you a list of this week’s five most frequently asked questions. I would always put this list at the top of any site’s Support page. They’re candid. Often people are looking in the FAQs for the answer to a question you’d rather they hadn’t asked. Candor in these situations goes a long way to increasing goodwill.

**2345 (highlight)**

Make it easy to recover from errors.


**2349 (highlight)**

If you can’t do what they want, at least let them know that you know you’re inconveniencing them.


**2474 (highlight)**

Add appropriate alt text to every image.


**2479 (highlight)**

Use headings correctly. The standard HTML heading elements convey useful information about the logical organization of your content to people using screen readers and make it easier for them to navigate via the keyboard. Use <h1> for the page title or main content heading, <h2> for the major section headings, <h3> for subheadings, and so on, and then use CSS to redefine the visual appearance of each level.

Useful: Does it do something people need done? Learnable: Can people figure out how to use it? Memorable: Do they have to relearn it each time they use it? Effective: Does it get the job done?

I know that we all love to have definitive answers, so here’s a tiny collection of things that you should always do or never do. Don’t use small, low-contrast type. You can use large, low-contrast type, or small (well, smallish) high-contrast type. But never use small, low-contrast type. (And try to stay away from the other two, too.)


**2639 (highlight)**

Preserve the distinction between visited and unvisited text links.


**2645 (highlight)**

Don’t float headings between paragraphs. Headings should be closer to the text that follows them than the text that precedes them.

A person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it’s worth.

Sometimes, though, particularly if you’re doing something original or groundbreaking or something that’s inherently complicated, you have to settle for self-explanatory.

The appearance of things (like size, color, and layout), their well-chosen names, and the small amounts of carefully crafted text should all work together to create a sense of nearly effortless understanding.

the main reason why it’s important not to make me think is that most people are going to spend far less time looking at the pages we design than we’d like to imagine.

Consistency is always a good thing to strive for within your site or app. If your navigation is always in the same place, for instance,


**547 (highlight)**

CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY If you can make something significantly clearer by making it slightly inconsistent, choose in favor of clarity.


**627 (highlight)**

Much of the time—perhaps most of the time—that users spend on your Web pages is spent scanning the text in search of something. The way your text is formatted can do a lot to make it easier for them.


**631 (highlight)**

Use plenty of headings. Well-written, thoughtful headings interspersed in the text act as an informal outline or table of contents for a page. They tell you what each section is about or, if they’re less literal, they intrigue you. Either way they help you decide which parts to read, scan, or skip. In general, you’ll want to use more headings than you’d think and put more time into writing them.


**640 (highlight)**

Don’t let your headings float. Make sure they’re closer to the section they introduce than to the section they follow.


**644 (highlight)**

Keep paragraphs short. Long paragraphs confront the reader with what Caroline Jarrett and Ginny Redish call a “wall of words.”


**648 (highlight)**

Even single-sentence paragraphs are fine.


**651 (highlight)**

Use bulleted lists. Think of it this way: Almost anything that can be a bulleted list probably should be. Just look at your paragraphs for any series of items separated by commas or semicolons and you’ll find likely candidates.


**666 (highlight)**

It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.


**673 (highlight)**

In general, I think it’s safe to say that users don’t mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued confidence that they’re on the right track—following


**675 (highlight)**

Links that clearly and unambiguously identify their target give off a strong scent that assures users that clicking them will bring them nearer to their “prey.”

Life is complicated, though, and some choices really aren’t simple. When you can’t avoid giving me a difficult choice, you need to go out of your way to give me as much guidance as I need—but no more. This guidance works best when it’s Brief: The smallest amount of information that will help me

“figuring out where you are” is a much more pervasive problem on the Web than in physical spaces.


**874 (highlight)**

Two of the purposes of navigation are fairly obvious: to help us find whatever it is we’re looking for and to tell us where we are. But navigation has some other equally important—and easily overlooked—functions:


**877 (highlight)**

navigation tells us what the site contains. Navigation reveals content!


**879 (highlight)**

It tells us how to use the site. If the navigation is doing its job, it tells you implicitly where to begin and what your options are. Done correctly, it should be all the instructions you need.


**882 (highlight)**

It gives us confidence in the people who built it. Every moment we’re in a Web site, we’re keeping a mental running tally: “Do these guys know what they’re doing?”


**883 (highlight)**

Clear, well-thought-out navigation is one of the best opportunities a site has to create a good impression.


**905 (highlight)**

Persistent navigation should include the four elements you most need to have on hand at all times:


**908 (highlight)**

There is one exception to the “follow me everywhere” rule: forms. On pages where a form needs to be filled in, the persistent navigation can sometimes be an unnecessary distraction. For instance, when I’m paying for my purchases on an e-commerce site, you don’t really want me to do anything but finish filling in the forms. The same is true when I’m registering, subscribing, giving feedback, or checking off personalization preferences. For these pages, it’s useful to have a minimal version of the persistent navigation with just the Site ID, a link to Home, and any Utilities that might help me fill out the form.


**940 (highlight)**

Utilities are the links to important elements of the site that aren’t really part of the content hierarchy. These are things that either can help me use the site (like Sign in/Register, Help, a Site Map, or a Shopping Cart) or provide information about its publisher (like About Us and Contact Us). Like the signs for the facilities in a store, the Utilities list should be slightly less prominent than the Sections.


**962 (highlight)**

As a rule, the persistent navigation can accommodate only four or five Utilities—the ones users are likely to need most often. If you try to squeeze in more than that, they tend to get lost in the crowd. The less frequently used leftovers belong in the footer: the small text links at the bottom of each page.


**968 (highlight)**

Almost all Web users expect the Site ID to be a button that can take you to the Home page. I think it’s also a good idea to include Home with the main sections of the site.


**970 (highlight)**

Given the power of searching and the number of people who prefer searching to browsing, unless a site is very small and very well organized, every page should have either a search box or a link to a search page.


**975 (highlight)**

It’s a simple formula: a box, a button, and either the word “Search” or the universally recognized magnifying glass icon. Don’t make it hard for them—stick to the formula. In particular, avoid


**983 (highlight)**

Options. If there is any possibility of confusion about the scope of the search (what’s being searched: the site, part of the site, or the whole Web), by all means spell it out. But think very carefully before giving me options to limit the scope (to search just the current section of the site, for instance). And also be wary of providing options for how I specify what I’m searching for (search by title or by author, for instance, or search by part number or by product name). I seldom see a case where the potential payoff for adding options to the persistent search box is worth the cost of making me figure out what the options are and whether I need to use them (i.e., making me think).
