The fact is, although trust is best, you don’t need it for successful negotiations. This is a big point and most people miss it: trust is not the major requirement for a successful negotiation. Something much more fundamental is needed. What is needed is a commitment. Trust is only one way to get a commitment. Contracts, third parties, and incentives are other ways to obtain commitments.

Moreover, the Chinese company should be advised that the nonpayment has also dishonored them in front of their own government. That’s because China was trying for international trade respect. Not paying legitimate business debts for work performed is against international standards. The Chinese company paid the debt in full within three weeks.

**1215 (highlight)**

How do we solve these problems of miscommunication and perception? The first thing you must realize is that these problems occur all the time, everywhere. First, question the language being used to see if you both mean the same thing.


**1220 (highlight)**

From now on, when you have a conflict with someone, ask yourself: (a) What am I perceiving? (b) What are they perceiving? (c) Is there a mismatch? (d) If so, why?


**1230 (highlight)**

What you must do first in a negotiation is get them ready to listen to you. Most people start with the facts. “My proposal is to offer you $200,000 for this house based on market conditions.” But as we have seen, the facts comprise less than 10 percent of the reason why people reach agreements or not. Other people will begin a negotiation by explaining the rational “interests.” “Housing prices are continuing to fall, so it’s best to sell now.” But neither facts nor rationality speaks to most of the people in the world. Rather, we need to start at the beginning: is the other person even ready to listen to me? To know that, you have to understand the pictures in their heads: their perceptions and feelings, how they view you and the rest of the world. If you don’t, you don’t have a starting point. You’re just walking around in the dark. In the example above, try something like this: “Hi, this is such a nice house you have. How long have you lived here?” Explaining your perceptions is the last thing you should do. First, learn their perceptions.


**1242 (highlight)**

One good way to find out the other person or party’s perceptions is to ask questions. In a negotiation, questions are far more powerful than statements. A statement commits you to whatever you said; it doesn’t get you any information, and it gives the other side something to throw things at. You become the target. A question, on the other hand, doesn’t commit you, usually gets you information, and gives you something to throw things at if you wish. Questions focus the other side on themselves. Almost everything you say in a negotiation should be a question.

**1271 (highlight)**

assume that questions can be seen as hostile. But there are all sorts of ways to ask questions. A favorite of mine is the tactic of the somewhat dated TV character Columbo: “Help me out here, I’m confused …” It’s a powerful way to ask a question—asking for the other person’s help. Here’s another powerful question stated in collaborative terms: “Please tell me where I’m wrong here.” If they tell you where you’re wrong, you get information that will help you in the next negotiation.


**1287 (highlight)**

Here are the basic components of effective communication: (1) always communicate, (2) listen and ask questions, (3) value, don’t blame them, (4) summarize often, (5) do role reversal, (6) be dispassionate, (7) articulate goals, (8) be firm without damaging the relationship, (9) look for small signals, (10) discuss perceptual differences, (11) find out how they make commitments, (12) consult before deciding, (13) focus on what you can control, and (14) avoid debating who is right.


**1298 (highlight)**

Talking is a sign of strength. Not talking is a sign of weakness. Yet that is exactly the opposite of conventional wisdom. I’m amazed at the number of labor-management negotiators, sports negotiators, attorneys, diplomats, and leaders of all sorts who, when things are not going well, walk out. That guarantees that things won’t go well.


**1327 (highlight)**

If the other party insults and threatens you, the correct response is, “Tell me more.” The more you know about a person, the better you can see how they think, the better you will be able to visualize the pictures in their heads. And the better negotiator you will be.


**1329 (note)**

ou meme simplement si l autre parti me dit "non"...  tell me more

focus on your goals, not on who is right. It didn’t matter if the connecting airline was late, or wrong in not calling ahead to the gate. The goal was to get on the plane to Paris.

Studies done with both children and adults over the past fifty years show that blaming people reduces performance and motivation. Praising people, on the other hand, improves both.

**1364 (highlight)**

Sum up what you think you are hearing with some frequency, and play it back to the other side in your own words. It values them and makes sure you are both still on the same page. They can see that you are listening to them, making it more likely that they will listen to you.


**1366 (note)**

super important tool


**1368 (highlight)**

It also gives you a chance to package, or frame, information in ways that put things in perspective: “As I understand it, you like our products better than theirs but you are still buying theirs.” Or “I got the highest rating in the department but I’m not getting a bonus, while others have. Is my understanding right?” Or “You’re saying, son, that even though you got Bs and Cs on your report card, you still believe you can get into an Ivy League school? How so?”


**137 (highlight)**

acknowledge the other party’s position and power, valuing them. If you do, they will often use their authority to help you achieve your goals.


**1376 (highlight)**

Role reversal means putting yourself in the shoes of the other party. It is one of the most important tools in this book. It will give you a better idea of the other person’s perceptions, of the pressures they may be under, of their dreams and fears. In other words, to understand people, you have to try to feel their pain, their happiness and uncertainty, and address it in your negotiation strategy. And you have to let them know you are trying.

A student was offered a job at Citigroup along with about fifty other graduating MBAs among thousands of applicants. Like most of my MBA students, no matter how much money he was offered, he wanted more money. The student came to see me for assistance. “What are your goals?” I asked. The student said that he wanted to differentiate himself among MBA graduates so he could rise faster in the company. He also said that he wanted the vice president who had hired him to be his mentor. I said we should take the goals one at a time. “First, if your goal is to differentiate yourself and most MBAs ask for more money, how does asking for more money differentiate yourself?” I said. “Good point,” he said. It’s always a good idea to see if your actions are meeting your goals. “Okay,” I said, “let’s take the second point. Who is this guy who you want as a mentor?” The student said it was the vice president for whom the student had worked the previous summer. The vice president, he said, had just developed a new program to rotate the fifty new hires through various departments the following September. The vice president was nervous about the rollout. So I said, “Put yourself in the shoes of the vice president. What are his hopes and fears? How can you help him?” The student did a role reversal, putting himself mentally in the vice president’s shoes, and realized what he needed to do. He called up the vice president and thanked him graciously for the job. Then the student said he was hoping that the vice president could be his mentor. In return, the student volunteered to do whatever he could to help in the intervening ten months. The student offered to interview people, conduct research, and do any other administrative tasks needed. “Interesting,” the vice president said. “Let me put you on hold for a minute or two. I’ll get right back to you.” When the vice president came back on the line, he said, “I’m going to tell you two things. First, I’m issuing you an immediate $15,000 bonus. Second, I want you to come to the worldwide Citigroup board of directors meeting next month to meet the chairman and the CEO of Citigroup.”


**1420 (highlight)**

Practice being the other side. Have your colleagues play you. Go through a negotiation simulation. You don’t need a lot of fancy theories. You just need knowledge of how to practice, the will to practice, and a little time. It will make you a stronger negotiator.


**1426 (highlight)**

The best negotiators are dispassionate, and continue to ask for information.


**1427 (highlight)**

Ask what they like most about your competitors and least about you.


**1455 (highlight)**

Before sending the email, reread it as the other person would read it in their foulest mood. Most emails come across as more aggressive than intended. You should think about the pictures in their heads in the worst case. It will reduce risk.


**1459 (highlight)**

Try never to send an email if you are upset or angry. You will say things you didn’t mean to say. Write the email if you wish, store it as a draft, and reread it later.


**1460 (highlight)**

Try to keep your emails short. Emails are not the best place to make complex proposals that take a lot of time to review. If you need to send a report, enclose it as an attachment; note the time frame (“at your convenience” or “in the next few days”) in which you would appreciate a read. This is sensitive to their time and avoids their putting their hand to their forehead and saying, “Oh geez, another long email!”


**1463 (note)**

nice!


**1467 (highlight)**

think about the other person’s communication style. Try to approximate it as closely as possible. You are not trying to mimic them; you are trying to translate for them. If the other person is a busy executive, he or she may want just a few words. The point is to make sure that the other person is hearing what you intended them to hear. And the manner in which you communicate has a lot to do with that.


**1477 (highlight)**

Most people will give you the means to persuade them if you watch and listen carefully. Too often, we don’t notice enough about others. Noticing signals of all sorts—verbal and nonverbal—provides much information that can be used for persuasion. If the other person says, “I can’t possibly do that for you at this time,” you should ask, “When can you do it?” or “Who else can?” If they say, “This is our standard contract,” you should ask, “Have you ever made an exception?” If they say, “We never negotiate on price,” you should ask, “Well, what do you negotiate on?” Look at every word, inflection, action.

**1488 (highlight)**

Japanese companies often bring a lot of people to meetings to carefully watch and listen to the other side: subtle turns of phrase, hand or eye movements, when they take notes, when they look down, and so forth. This provides a great deal of information. After the meeting, the Japanese team gets together and compares notes. What does this mean for you? It means that when you go to a meeting of any significance, bring someone with you. When your colleague is talking, listen and watch carefully. You will pick up signals invisible to those not paying close attention.


**1521 (highlight)**

you need to have an explicit conversation about how they make and keep commitments.


**1577 (highlight)**

Not fighting over yesterday is liberating in a negotiation. You encourage the other parties to talk only about those things over which they have control. It helps separate what’s relevant from what is not.


**1595 (highlight)**

Blaming the city, we said, would not meet the company’s goal of getting a clean bill of health from the federal government. Being right was not the company’s goal. Not having a big regulatory fine was the company’s goal. Preserving the company’s great reputation was the company’s goal.


**1606 (highlight)**

Each tool in this chapter is subtle. Each requires only small changes in what you say in a negotiation. You don’t have to use all these tools at once. Try one or two of them. Practice them. Build some confidence, and get results. Then try something else.


**1608 (note)**

how to practice


**249 (highlight)**

To find the real problem, you have to find out why the other party is acting the way they are. It may not be obvious at first. You have to probe until you find it. You have to get into their shoes. A dispute over a child’s curfew or a business valuation may really be a problem of trust and an opportunity for a better relationship.


**275 (highlight)**

My most common opening in a negotiation is “What’s going on?” Seems like an ordinary question. But there are at least four tools folded into that question. First, it helps to establish a relationship with the other person—you start out informal and chatty. Second, it is a question—questions are a great way to collect information. Third, it focuses first on the other party and their feelings and perceptions, instead of on “the deal.” Fourth, it consists of small talk to establish a comfort level between us.


**284 (highlight)**

Common enemies bring parties closer together and make the negotiation easier. That’s why people complain about the weather; it establishes a human connection, and a shared vantage point. People complain half-jokingly about attorneys, or traffic, or bureaucracy for exactly that reason.


**303 (highlight)**

Power must be used gingerly, tactfully, with the approval of others (in the military or courts, for example), and for fairness.

Getting People to Think What You Want Them to Think. This second level is better: getting people to see the rational benefit in your idea. This is what has been called “interest-based negotiation,” and popularized in many negotiation books. However, it depends on people being rational.


**354 (highlight)**

3. Getting People to Perceive What You Want Them to Perceive. Now you are looking at the world the way the other side does. And you are thinking of ways to change their perceptions. You are starting with the pictures in their heads. This is the right place to begin in order to persuade them.

You are starting with the pictures in their heads. This is the right place to begin in order to persuade them. Misperception, often from communication failures, causes conflict and negotiation breakdowns everywhere, every day. Understanding others’ perceptions is essential to successful negotiation. You then change their perceptions incrementally. It will actually make the negotiation shorter, more self-enforcing, and easier.


**358 (note)**

use this when talking to arnaud


**361 (highlight)**

A negotiation that considers feelings is much broader than “interests.” And it includes all needs—the entire menu of what people want—from the reasonable to the crazy. When the other party realizes you care about their feelings, they will listen more, making them more persuadable. In my experiance, few people acknowledge or use this in negotiations. Imagine opposing attorneys, or sports owners with striking players, or the United States with Iran, saying, “Before we sit down to formally talk about the issues, how do you guys feel? Are you happy? What is your favorite food? How’s your family?” And yet this is what is required to get the best results. Throughout this book, you will see that people who did this negotiated better and got more.


**374 (highlight)**

Think how much more effective you would be if you spent ten or fifteen minutes before a negotiation going down the List and asking how each strategy applies in this instance. Did you find out enough about the other party? Are your goals clearly defined? Are you being incremental enough? Afterward, you will assess how you did using the List, perhaps changing it a little, and learning for next time.


**3866 (highlight)**

What I am talking about here is building your own coalition. It takes time, it takes effort and thought. But it takes less time and work than finding another job, or not getting the promotions and raises you might otherwise get. Be incremental about this. Ask people about their job. Find out their dreams and fears. Give them information when you can. Offer them advice or a set of helpful hands. Start with a single person or two. What you are doing is collecting as much information as you can about the place where you work or want to work.


**3905 (highlight)**

“Provide them with a specific solution. It takes time, but it works.”


**3911 (highlight)**

“I realize that your team has made its decision regarding my candidacy, but I am hoping you will give me a chance should this position or another become available,” Mark wrote, in a tactful and humble way.


**405 (highlight)**

How many times have you gone to a meeting and said to the people there, “What do you want at the end of this meeting that you don’t have now?” If you haven’t done this before, try it. It’s very effective. Although people will sometimes lie or refuse to say, by and large people will tell you. And you will quickly find out whether everyone thinks they are at the same meeting with the same goals.


**410 (highlight)**

Not having a goal is like getting into the car without knowing where you are headed. And not checking your goals is like not checking the map along the way. People often get distracted in the middle of a meeting or a campaign. New information often emerges. Unless you check your goals at intervals, you are less likely to meet them.


**426 (highlight)**

“Are my actions meeting my goals?” The world is full of people who fail to do this. They get emotional or distracted or are just not thinking this way. It goes for you, and it goes for others you care about. Angela Arnold’s father had a stroke. He wanted to leave the hospital before his rehab was complete. Angela, now a consultant, asked her father what he was most looking forward to at home. “Walking Ringo,” his dog, Angela’s father said. “Well,” Angela said, “if you want to walk Ringo, and you leave the hospital now, you won’t be able to walk Ringo.” She said if he finished rehab, he’d be able to walk unassisted upon discharge. Then he could walk Ringo. Angela showed her father that his proposal would not have met his goals. Her


**452 (highlight)**

This does not mean you should try to be someone else. Most people are bad at acting. People will detect it and you will lose your credibility. The most important asset you have in any human interaction is your credibility. If people don’t believe you, it’s hard to convince them of anything. Your credibility is more important than your expertise, connections, intelligence, assets, and looks.


**464 (highlight)**

When I go to another country and don’t know the culture well, I will often apologize in advance. I will tell the other person, “I might accidentally say something inappropriate. I wish I knew your culture better. Every time I make a mistake, could you please advise me?” I’ve now turned every instance of potential conflict into an instance of collaboration, in which they are my advisors.


**467 (highlight)**

Great negotiators have a firm grasp of the obvious. If you are not getting along in a negotiation with the other party, you should say, “I don’t think we’re getting along here. Why not?” You might as well say it. The other party is thinking it.


**471 (highlight)**

Transparency also means you should share these tools with the other side. The more people who know of these tools, the better the negotiation will be. Because this is not about getting the better of someone. This is about getting more. So give the List to your spouse, your kids, your friends, and your business associates. This is counterintuitive to most people. Most negotiators think they should be anything but transparent. However, the result is a lack of trust. This doesn’t mean you have to disclose everything. It does mean you should disclose as much as you can to meet your goals and make the other side comfortable. For the rest you can say, “I’m just not comfortable telling you this yet.”


**483 (highlight)**

big, bold moves mostly scare people away: you are trying to go too far, too fast. Small, incremental steps accomplish more. This is especially true if two parties are far apart in a negotiation. Incremental steps give other people a chance to catch their breath, look around, decide if the steps you’ve taken feel good, and then move on with confidence. Incremental steps anchor people to the step or steps they have already accepted. They reduce the perceived risk of moving forward.


**506 (highlight)**

Here is my entire negotiation course in three broad questions. What are my goals? Who are “they”? What will it take to persuade them?


**511 (highlight)**

The third question depends on the answers to the first two. And this is why you need the List. You choose from the List, and from the various supporting individual tools, based on goals and people.


**547 (highlight)**

To get better, you need to practice with these tools. Rayenne Chen, the woman at the beginning of the book who got the pilots to bring back the plane, had a List. That was her starting point. But it wasn’t enough. Her List was internalized through practice: conscious practice.


**582 (highlight)**

Good instincts are not enough. So use the List. Take it with you from negotiation to negotiation. Figure out what you did right and wrong the last time. Modify your List. Do this often. Practice one strategy at a time. See what happens. Learn from it, then do it again.


**592 (note)**

**595 (highlight)**

But in order to meet your goals, you will also need to help other people get better.


**598 (highlight)**

you will need to help others because most people don’t know how to set their goals or meet them. They don’t know how to listen or find the pictures in other people’s heads. They are mostly confrontational and defensive and have the wrong attitude. You’ll need to help them define their goals, meet their needs, get more. Most hard bargainers are unskilled negotiators; they don’t know any other way. But until the other party shows you they are a lost cause, you should try to help them. That doesn’t mean taking a lot of risk yourself. Take a small, incremental step and see what happens. Ask, “Would you like to make an agreement that is reasonable for both of us?” If they say yes, then define how the parties might go about it.


**603 (highlight)**

Bob Woolf, the retired sports-agent superstar, essentially said to others in a negotiation, “I have one thing that’s not negotiable. I demand that we meet your interests.” When the other person expressed surprise, he would say something like, “The reason we need to meet your interests is that if we don’t meet your interests, you won’t meet mine. And I’m a real selfish guy. I want my interests met.”


**686 (highlight)**

“I evaluate all interactions in a different way now. My awareness of others is incredibly acute. My life is fundamentally changed.”


**692 (highlight)**

He had a number of substantive issues and wanted to know the order in which to bring them up—royalties, basic compensation, etc. I told him to put aside these issues, at least for now. That’s not the problem. The problem is that everyone is mad at everyone else and everyone is losing money. “Make small talk,” I said. “Ask them, ‘Are you happy?’ ” They will not be happy, and they will admit it, I said. They may start blaming the Writers Guild. That’s okay, I told Bowman. “Commiserate with them,” I said. “Ask them, ‘If we had to start over again, what process would you like to see?’ ”

A big confidence builder in doing a negotiation is preparation. The more prepared you are, the less nervous and more effective you will be. You won’t be busy trying to remember what you’re supposed to do next.

**7024 (highlight)**

How can you make yourself and others more comfortable? This is exactly the opposite of what people often do, which is try to make others less comfortable.


**7025 (highlight)**

Of course, if the other person or party is pressed for time, don’t waste their time. Ask them how much time they have. It’s another way to make the connection. It shows that you value them, and their time.


**7033 (highlight)**

Even in a short negotiation, you should know specifically what you are going to talk about. That is, what subjects will be covered, and in what order. Get an agenda that both parties agree to. This will help the parties get back on track if they get lost. It will also help organize things.

How long will the negotiation take? Sometimes circumstances dictate this. Other times, have a discussion about this. It’s often best to break a negotiation incrementally into smaller pieces. Every time you get new information that can affect the negotiation, consider taking a break to think about it, and then resume.

Start with the easy things. It gives the parties a sense of accomplishment and progress as they agree on them.

**7046 (highlight)**

try to set a time limit on issues. For example, anything you can’t solve in fifteen minutes, go on to the next issue. That way, you get as many issues out of the way as you can. Also, try never to commit to any one thing until you see the entire package of points to be negotiated.


**7049 (highlight)**

You need to discuss the other person’s perceptions every time you confront an issue. Through your preparation and role reversal before the negotiation, you should already have ideas about this that you can share. If you want to persuade them, their perceptions are the starting point.

If something surprises you, take a break immediately. My team once took five breaks in the first hour of a merger negotiation

**7054 (highlight)**

It’s okay if more than one person from each side talks, as long as it’s not confusing and you are in agreement. That is, if people have assigned roles or you are brainstorming. If a contradiction emerges, call for a break. Tell the other side something like, “When we figure out what we really mean, we’ll let you know.” People don’t expect you to be perfect. They do expect you to be real.


**706 (highlight)**

From time immemorial, people have come to negotiations armed with their lists of topics to push from the start. Here are my issues. Here is my proposal. Wrong! Unless you connect in some way with the people you are negotiating with, you won’t get a deal.


**7060 (highlight)**

If you realize you don’t have enough time to cover everything, don’t. Get a couple of things done very well, rather than a lot of things done poorly.


**7069 (highlight)**

you could issue a veiled threat, such as, “If we don’t reach an agreement, it will hurt your reputation.” Or you could say instead, “How can we help you use this deal to enhance your reputation?” The latter is a “collaborative threat,” as noted earlier.

Remember, you are the least important person in the negotiation. The most important person is them. And the second most important person is a third party important to the negotiators. If you don’t accept this, you won’t persuade many people of anything.

information is based, as perceived by the other party. Not you, but the other party. Even a madman thinks his offer is reasonable. You need to look into the head of the other party and figure out what they think.


**7123 (highlight)**

What if an extreme offer is made to you? The antidotes are (a) not reacting emotionally, (b) asking questions, and (c) using standards. Maybe they’re not trying to take advantage of you. Maybe they don’t know how to negotiate effectively. Maybe someone taught them to do this. So ask them how they got to this offer. Did they pick it out of a hat? Do they have some data? Also, you can say that the offer is out of line with what you’ve seen elsewhere. So where did they get their information?


**715 (highlight)**

Even with the same six people, someone may have had a bad commute that morning, someone else may not be feeling well, someone’s kid might be sick, someone might be distracted by something else. So the first thing you have to do is take the emotional and situational temperature of the people sitting across from you, even if you know them very well.

If they have a lot more raw power than you do, they can certainly beat you up. In such a case, you should acknowledge their power, giving them an emotional payment. And you should ask them, just because they can beat you up, should they? For example, if an opera house can beat down a star performer in negotiations, how will that performer feel? Will he or she be as motivated to give a great performance, thus benefiting the opera house? If you can beat up employees, will they work less hard for you? Better to focus on meeting needs and expanding the pie by using the tools in this book. And feel free to have a frank discussion about power with your counterparts. Feel free to educate them, tactfully, if they are misguided. Remember, though, they might be emotional about their power, so they may need emotional payments.


**7172 (highlight)**

As noted earlier, prioritize the issues based on what is easiest and fastest. Easiest is a subset of fastest in most cases. You should do all the things now that you can do now. Then tackle the medium-term things. And then the long-term things.

**7184 (highlight)**

You need a commitment from them in the way they make commitments. This should be explicitly discussed as part of the negotiation.


**7185 (note)**

leur demander ce qui constitue un engagement de leur part: parole ou contrat. moi ma parole vaut


**7188 (highlight)**

The making of a commitment also needs a deadline and a time frame. This needs to be explicit. If there are any conditions that will cause the other party (or you) to be able to get out of the commitment, spell them out.

**7196 (highlight)**

Clearly, the more risk one takes, the more one is entitled to be compensated in some way. So a key thing to do in a negotiation is to understand the other party’s risk profile. Then try to minimize their perceived risk. If you reduce their perceived risk, they will pay you more if you are a seller, or take less if you are a buyer.


**7198 (note)**

leur demander explicitementes risques qu'ils percoivent


**721 (highlight)**

But neither issues nor interests are good enough. To be really effective, one has to start all the way back at the beginning. What is the other person feeling? How do they perceive the situation? What are the pictures in their heads?


**739 (highlight)**

And if the other side doesn’t like you, and they don’t trust you, they won’t hear you. Just because you’re yakking at them, and they are going, “Uh-huh, uh-huh,” doesn’t mean they hear a word you say. And when people are angry, confused, or uncertain, they physiologically hear less.


**755 (highlight)**

if you are having trouble with the other party in discussing the issues, stop! Go back to talking about the people, and then fix any problems there. Don’t forge madly ahead.

if you are having trouble with the other party in discussing the issues, stop! Go back to talking about the people, and then fix any problems there. Don’t forge madly ahead. If you do, you won’t get a deal, or if you do, the deal won’t stick. A woman was in a very sensitive job buyout negotiation in Los Angeles. Day one was fine, day two was not fine. So she stopped talking about the issues and said to the other person, “Mark, we had a good day yesterday, but today we’re not. If it’s something I said or did, I’m sorry. I want to get us back on track. What’s going on?” Mark apologized for being distracted. It turned out to be something else entirely. They rechecked their process and successfully finished the negotiation.

Focusing on the people also means that when you are negotiating with representatives of a group, you should be focusing on the individuals in the group.

Even the most extreme of parties are not monolithic. Imagine you were a Jew in Poland in 1944. You thought all Nazis were evil. If you then met Oskar Schindler, you would have lost your life. That’s because Schindler, although a Nazi, was willing to save your life. But you never asked him, because you thought all Nazis hated Jews. What a source of competitive advantage it is to know who’s really the same and who’s really different, whether in business or personal life. And you can’t tell just by considering external features or affiliations. As such, you will be able to make alliances and deals with people from other groups, where the less precise and less skilled negotiators will fail.


**836 (highlight)**

Very few people ignore the opinions of third parties who are important to them. When you need to influence someone, and you don’t think you have enough influence by yourself, think about who else is important to the other person and whom you may have an easier time influencing.

So I thought about the pictures in his head. I thought about what he does every day. Finally it hit me how I could value him. “You know,” I said conspiratorially, “between you and this other car, you are the only professional driver here.” He backed up.

cest si simple et si subtil... essayer de voir au traversdes yeux de son  interlocuteur


**876 (highlight)**

I said, “Thank you so much, Officer, for stopping me and doing your job. You probably just saved my life.” Did I get a ticket? Absolutely not. Of course, you have to mean it. If you say things like this without genuine sincerity, you are going to get a ticket. If you hate all police officers, it will come across. You need to think about all daily encounters as negotiations, and practice to the point where you can focus on the other party quickly. In other words, they must genuinely feel that the negotiation is about them and their needs and perceptions, not yours. The police officer wants to feel that you have learned a lesson.


**883 (highlight)**

What are they thinking and feeling? What would cause them to keep talking to me? What would cause them to make a connection with me? You need to be open and curious enough to try to find out the pictures in their heads,


**904 (highlight)**

So how do you find out about other people? You make small talk. Not just because you read somewhere that it’s smart to make small talk. You do it because you are interested in them. Because you want to try for a point of connection with other people. It’s a way of approaching life. It’s also a way of approaching others. A new waitress at Champps Restaurant in Philadelphia was trying to handle a lot of tables. It was taking a long time for one of my students and her friends to get their dinner. So she called the waitress over and thanked her for her efforts, valuing her. The student said she realized the waitress was new and very busy. Could she bring an appetizer while they were waiting? The waitress brought a free appetizer and then took the price of the entrées off the bill: everything but the drinks was free. “The waitress essentially paid me for being nice and understanding,” my student said.

The public often treats people in service positions like servants. They will be extremely grateful if you treat them with dignity.

Even if they have little power, giving them power by acknowledging what they have control over will lead them to give you something back.

leur faire realiser quils ont du pouvoir


**943 (highlight)**

The key is not being reactive even if the other person is in a bad mood. Often, people will lash out at you just because they are frustrated from some other encounter. Don’t assume it’s about you. Tell them you’re sorry they are having a bad day. You will reap all the benefits. It takes discipline, but the rewards are worth it.


**957 (highlight)**

An important way to empower them, too, rarely used, is to give them the problem. Use empathy or just ask them for help. When you involve people in your problems, they will feel empowered, they will take ownership, they will be more likely to help you. Ask them for help.
