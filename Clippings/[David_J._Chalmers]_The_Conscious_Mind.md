if consciousness is not logically supervenient on the physical, then materialism is false.


**2558 (highlight)**

This failure of materialism leads toa kind of dualism: there are both physical and nonphysical features of the world. The falsity of logical supervenience implies that experience is fundamentally different in kind from any physical feature.


**2571 (highlight)**

The dualism implied here is insteada kind of property dualism: conscious experience involves properties of an individual that are not entailed by the physical properties of that individual, although they may depend lawfully on those properties. Consciousness isa feature of the world over and above the physical features of the world. This is not to say it isa separate "substance";


**2582 (highlight)**

It remains plausible, however, that consciousness arises froma physical basis, even though it is not entailed by that basis. The position we are left with is that consciousness arises froma physical substrate in virtue of certain contingent laws of nature, which are not themselves implied by physical laws.

Whena concert-goer sighs ata particularly exquisite movement, one might have thought that the experienced quality of auditory sensations might be central to an explanation of this behavior, but it turns out that an explanation can be given entirely in terms of auditory perception and functional responses.


**3832 (highlight)**

All this is to say (expanding ona claim in Chapter 1) that consciousness is surprising, but claims about consciousness are not. Although consciousness isa feature of the world that we would not predict from the physical facts, the things we say about consciousness are a garden-variety cognitive phenomenon. Somebody who knew enough about cognitive structure would immediately be able to predict the likelihood of utterances such as "I feel conscious, ina way that no physical object could be," or even Descartes's "Cogito ergo sum."


**4309 (highlight)**

By analogy, the cornerstone ofa theory of consciousness will bea set of psychophysical laws governing the relationship between consciousness and physical systems. We have already granted that consciousness supervenes naturally (although not logically) on the physical. This supervenience must be underwritten by psychophysical laws; an account of these laws will tell us just how consciousness depends on physical processes. Given the physical facts about a system, such laws will enable us to infer what sort of conscious experience will be associated with the system, if any.


**4331 (highlight)**

We should seek to explain the supervenience of consciousness upon the physical in terms of the simplest possible set of laws.


**4464 (highlight)**

The principle is that when we have an experience, we are aware of the contents of the experience. When we experiencea book, we are aware of the book; when we experiencea pain, we are aware of something hurtful; when we experiencea thought, we are aware of whatever it is that the thought is about. It is not a matter of an experience followed bya separate judgment, as might be the case for second-order judgments; these first-order judgments are concomitants of experiences, existing alongside them. The tie between experiences and second-order judgments is much more indirect: although we have the ability to notice our experiences, most of the time we notice only the contents of the experience, not the experience itself. Only occasionally do we sit back and take notice of our experience of the red book; usually we just think about the book. Where second-order judgments are infrequent, first-order judgments are ubiquitous. The most direct link is therefore the link between consciousness and first-order judgments.

One example is blindsight (described in Weiskrantz 1986). This isa deficit arising from damage to the visual cortex, in which the usual route for visual information processing is damaged, but in which visual information nevertheless seems to be processed ina limited way. Subjects with blindsight can see nothing in certain areas of their visual field, or so they say. If one putsa red or green light in their ''blind area" they claim to see nothing. But when one forces them to makea choice about what is in that area—on whethera red or green light is present, for example—it turns out that they are right far Page 227 more often than they are wrong. Somehow they are ''seeing" what is in the area without really seeing it.


**4767 (highlight)**

Using these methods, we might even get some insight into what it is like to be a bat! Functional organization can tell us much about the kind of information thata bat has access to—the kinds of discriminations it can make, the ways it categorizes things, the most salient properties in its perceptual field, and so on—and about the way in which it uses it. Eventually we should be able to build upa detailed picture about the structure of awareness ina bat's cognitive system. By the principle of structural coherence, we will then havea good idea about the structure of the bat's experiences. We will not know everything about what it is like to bea bat—we will not havea clear conception of the intrinsic nature of the experiences, for instance—but we will know quite a bit.


**4904 (highlight)**

We can therefore put forward the hypothesis that this coherence isa law of nature: in any system, consciousness will be accompanied by awareness, and vice versa.


**4912 (highlight)**

not only does consciousness arise from awareness, but the structure of consciousness is determined by the structure of awareness.


**4914 (highlight)**

awareness." But not all laws are fundamental laws. It may even be that the coherence principles are not strict laws; there may be some exceptions around the edges, especially given the underdetermined nature of the concept of awareness.


**4930 (highlight)**

The remaining question then, is: What is the extra something, or is nothing extra required? Call the hypothetical extra ingredient the X-factor. Either I am conscious in virtue of awareness alone, or I am conscious in virtue of awareness and the X-factor.


**4941 (highlight)**

The same goes for more "plausible" X-factors that someone might put forward seriously.A natural candidate for such an X-factor is cell-based biology, or even human neurophysiology. Certainly some people have supposed that consciousness is limited to beings with the right kind of biological make-up. Ina similar way, some have suggested that consciousness arises from functional organization only when that organization is not implemented ina "homunculi-headed" manner, as in the example of the Chinese nation. But X-factors like these are equally arbitrary. They only complicate the laws without any added compensation. Why should the world be set up so that awareness gives rise to consciousness only in beings witha particular biology, or such that internal homunculi are ruled out? The hypotheses seem baroque, with extraneous distractions built in. Why might someone believe in an X-factor?I think such beliefs arise for a natural but misleading reason. There isa basic intuition that consciousness Page 245 is something over and above functional organization. This is an intuition that of courseI share—consciousness is a further fact, for which no functional organization is logically sufficient. There is alsoa natural tendency to believe that everything is physical, and that consciousness must be physically explainable one way or another. Faced with these two pressures, there isa natural reaction: we have to add something extra, and the extra something must be physical. Human biology isa natural candidate for that extra ingredient. In this way, it might be thought that we have bridged the gap from functional organization to human biology. But this is quite misguided. The addition of biology into the picture has not helped the original problem at all. The gap is as large as ever: consciousness seems to be something over and above biology, too. As argued earlier, no physical facts suffice to explain consciousness.


**4954 (note)**

not fully convincing. i don't rul out that some specific feature of cell based biology give rise to consciousness. and his argumet against this idea is his premise, that i dont surely agree on, that consciousness is not logicqlly supervenien on the physical (cf last sentence)


**4955 (highlight)**

Once we accept that materialism is false, it becomes clear that the search for a physical X-factor is irrelevant; instead, we have to look for a ''Y-factor," something additional to the physical facts that will help explain consciousness. We find sucha Y-factor in the postulation of irreducible psychophysical laws. Once we have imported these into our framework, the intuition that consciousness isa further fact is preserved, and the problem is removed.


**4958 (note)**

for ex: awareness givss rise to consciouness in systemw that are capable of reconizing or memorising x patterns or pattens of a compexity of n


**4966 (highlight)**

Some people will still be unsure about the functionalist conclusion thatI have reached, even if it isa dualist version of functionalism. It is true that the argument from X-factors is somewhat tentative and relies strongly on simplicity assumptions.I will give more concrete arguments for the same conclusion in the next chapter, using thought experiments to make the case thata functional replica ofa conscious being will have precisely the same Page 246 kind of conscious experience.


**4990 (highlight)**

If consciousness arises from the physical, in virtue of what sort of physical properties does it arise? Presumably these will be properties that brains can instantiate, but it is not obvious just which properties are the right ones. Some have suggested biochemical properties; some have suggested quantum properties; many have professed uncertainty.A natural suggestion is that consciousness arises in virtue of the functional organization of the brain. On this view, the chemical and indeed the quantum substrate of the brain is irrelevant to the production of consciousness. What counts is the brain's abstract causal organization, an organization that might be realized in many different physical substrates.
