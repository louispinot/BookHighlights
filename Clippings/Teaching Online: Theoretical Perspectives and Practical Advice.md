**1010 (highlight)**

Online students look for frequent and open communication with their peers and instructors.


**1012 (highlight)**

The experience that a student has will be greatly impacted by the role the instructor chooses to play.


**106 (highlight)**

Most people are not properly trained to critically evaluate all this information; misinformation or information overload is the likely result.


**139 (highlight)**

Online courses therefore represent a unique opportunity for peer learning.


**149 (highlight)**

Traditional textbook design is fairly firmly rooted in the objectivist paradigm, and relies heavily on front-end analysis and expected learning outcomes, using a linear approach with a clearly defined path through the material. Constructivist-inspired techniques, on the other hand, are becoming important in professional education, and designers working in this tradition use multi-disciplinary, “messy”, real-life problems as starting points for learning.


**161 (highlight)**

The new mobile application, however, requires that one learns not only how to use a particular smartphone, but also how to download and use the appropriate application.


**164 (highlight)**

The purpose of these two types of courses is fundamentally different, in that most of the for-credit academic courses can be characterized as just-in-case, whereas corporate training most often contain just-in-time material.


**170 (highlight)**

Such general knowledge still provides an important framework, but keeping on top of constant expansions, additions and changes is paramount.

**192 (highlight)**

It is not unreasonable to expect that the future degree model will be one of fewer, longer foundation courses complemented by shorter modules of just-in-time material.


**220 (highlight)**

needs much more control of where, when, and in which order to approach the content.


**226 (highlight)**

helping the students take more responsibility for their own learning;


**236 (highlight)**

Students are in more control over their own learning; therefore, the delivery needs to take their needs into account to a much larger degree in order to retain them as “customers.”


**240 (highlight)**

in order for students to retain and apply what they learn, the learning experience should be collaborative, facilitate applying the new knowledge to various real-life scenarios,


**247 (highlight)**

students more flexibility, but also much more responsibility for their own learning. Appropriate automated prompting tools that encourage and reinforce this responsibility will increase success rates.


**249 (highlight)**

Provided there are many well-structured opportunities for interaction, it is possible to create vibrant interaction among the participants. For students moving through material as a cohort, this might include synchronous chat-room sessions. For students accessing material individually, they might participate in asynchronous interaction with others who happen to take the same module.


**253 (highlight)**

When interacting with well-designed online material, the students can choose their own path through the course. Depending on their learning style, they can start with the cases or problems, or work on the basic concepts and techniques first.


**258 (highlight)**

(interactive exercises with immediate responses, graphical representations of various scenarios which immediately respond to student manipulation, threaded discussions where the conversations can be continued beyond class time, etc.);


**261 (highlight)**

shorter courses, modularized for convenient retrieval, delivery


**265 (highlight)**

Generally, large chunks of text should not be replicated online.


**342 (highlight)**

In a regular classroom, a perceptive professor can easily spot students who display that “I am totally lost” expression. Due to the lack of visual clues in an online setting, struggling students can easily fall behind because nobody around them understands


**367 (highlight)**

Attending a traditional lecture is, for most of us, one of the least effective ways to learn; anecdotal evidence indicates that we often retain less than 10% of a lecture over time. Still, it is not uncommon for most adult learners to have 80% or more of the content in a course or a program delivered this way. This goes for education delivered via the Internet as well, with written material representing the online equivalent of a traditional lecture in a face-to-face setting.


**367 (highlight)**

Attending a traditional lecture is, for most of us, one of the least effective ways to learn; anecdotal evidence indicates that we often retain less than 10% of a lecture over time.


**371 (highlight)**

effective knowledge transfer needs to be the basis of how the content is designed, retrieved and utilized.


**383 (highlight)**

Principles inherent in this approach, such as making learning relevant for the student’s need and allowing for application to real-life issues,


**386 (highlight)**

The andragogic model asserts that various issues need to be addressed when designing content, including letting learners know why something is important to learn, assisting learners to direct themselves through information, and relating the material to the learners’ experiences.


**390 (highlight)**

often uses more visual content that can be accessed via various paths and may require some kind of manipulation by the learner.

found that adult students placed the highest value on relevance to life and reflective thinking.


**412 (highlight)**

the students preferred to learn in a meaningful setting where they were active participants in the process.

problem-based learning, a student-centered instructional strategy in which students collaboratively use real-world problems as a starting point for their learning.


**501 (highlight)**

task and the learning environment must reflect the environment in which the learner needs to function at the end of the learning process,


**506 (highlight)**

For most of us it is challenging to see the full picture when so much of what we learned seems like unrelated pieces of a puzzle. If these students get to see the entire picture first, it is easier for them to recognize the situation and retrieve the related material.


**525 (highlight)**

Problem-based learning is not the same as the case method. In PBL, the problems act as the absolute starting point for learning, while the case method uses problems later in the learning process.


**527 (highlight)**

professor functions as a facilitator and guide as the students define areas for investigation, consult resources and develop and present possible solutions to the problem


**556 (highlight)**

The instructional designer interacts closely with content experts and graphic designers,


**587 (note)**

what to avoid!


**587 (highlight)**

“an online textbook” where the content is text-based and the path through the content is linear.


**594 (highlight)**

The most helpful online material is engaging and context-based, with ample opportunities for interaction.


**598 (highlight)**

The more information students retain, retrieve and use, the more successful they will feel.


**612 (highlight)**

A challenge in regard to games and education is therefore, on the one side, to harvest the many intuitive learning designs inherent in games, while at the same time to foster longer attention spans, deeper exploration and higher order analytical skills that characterize good approaches to teaching and learning.


**627 (highlight)**

“Gamification is using game-based mechanics, aesthetics and game thinking to engage people, motivate action, promote learning, and solve problems”


**649 (highlight)**

Motivation is a powerful tool in education. One model that captures this is known as ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction)


**652 (highlight)**

First of all, in order for content to be meaningful for the students, it needs to grab and hold their attention. One way to do this is to use scenarios that the players can relate to, that spark their curiosity and that are varied enough to keep their excitement level high.


**655 (highlight)**

Confidence within this model refers to the expectation of the learner that they can succeed. Important in this regard are clear expectations and incremental opportunities for success along the way.


**664 (highlight)**

Aspects are progressively disclosed as a player moves through the game. This is similar to a good math course in that lower level skills are needed to understand more complicated concepts. What makes games so intriguing in this regard is that players learn by playing.


**691 (highlight)**

Among their main findings are that higher cognitive gains were found in those who use simulations or games, that games and simulations lead to a more positive attitude toward learning, and that the findings held true across gender, age and various situational factors.


**696 (highlight)**

various instructional support features (e.g., elaborative feedback and pedagogical agents such as an animated figure) are important.


**708 (highlight)**

Video games are individual/personal for each user, allowing the user a personal path through the learning experience.


**711 (highlight)**

The user learns what she needs to know during the video game, as part of the video game;


**728 (highlight)**

Rules-based knowledge deals with relationships between concepts. In the car quality example above, a quiet engine would be related to a high quality driving experience. Ways in which games present such knowledge include providing examples, role play and experiencing consequences.


**729 (note)**

this is a major type of knowledge fo coding


**803 (highlight)**

By listening to (in real-life or online) the master/facilitator explain exactly what he or she is doing and thinking as he or she models the skill, the learner can identify relevant behaviors and develop an understanding of the processes


**805 (highlight)**

The learner then attempts to imitate those behaviors with the facilitator assessing the learner’s progress and providing coaching.


**806 (note)**

**807 (highlight)**

corrective feedback and reminders, all intended to bring the learner's performance closer to that of the master’s.


**816 (highlight)**

Busy professors cannot be expected to spend a lot of one-on-one time with their students. This is where online modules and full-length courses offer a realistic alternative. Such learning modules, when designed with the cognitive apprenticeship model in mind, can act as an online mentor (master) in relation to the students.


**818 (note)**

quand je redige mon cours, m'imaginer que je suis en 1 to 1 avec l'eleve devan moi


**83 (highlight)**

Such educational tools would adapt to individuals over time, allowing the system to understand individual strengths and weaknesses, personal preferences, attention patterns, as well as non-cognitive factors (tenacity, perseverance, goal-setting,


**832 (highlight)**

An instructor gives a lecture that covers the subject matter, whereas a facilitator helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content.


**85 (highlight)**

would adapt content and presentation modalities accordingly as it learns about the student.


**853 (highlight)**

in effective, sustainable knowledge transfer, the level of assistance provided to the learner is systematically reduced as the learner demonstrates increased mastery of the subject or skill.


**857 (highlight)**

In online content based on this principle the learner chooses the path of instruction and amount of assistance provided.


**881 (highlight)**

Pedagogically powerful online content should facilitate seamless multi-level and multi-dimensional learning, using a blend of these six levels.


**903 (highlight)**

Good online content should therefore be designed to provide information in context, used in the situation in which it will be applied and take place in hands-on situations. The approach should include capabilities for collecting feedback that can in turn be used to continually improve the content and delivery.


**913 (highlight)**

Good online content creation technology should represent a user-friendly and pedagogically sound way to truly mirror the cognitive apprenticeship model


**930 (highlight)**

The quality of the product (the education), as well as the service (the overall experience) dictate the reputation and repeat business that a learning institution will enjoy.


**95 (highlight)**

needs is cognitive apprenticeship (detailed in Chapter 6), where the “master” is responsible for knowledge transfer as an expert facilitator unlike an instructor in the traditional lecture format approach.


**968 (highlight)**

professor participation in online interactions was important or extremely important.


**972 (highlight)**

Many students touted peer interaction as a valuable method of learning through the sharing of information and experiences related to topics studied. This sharing can transpire through group work, asynchronous message boards, online chat rooms and classrooms.


**974 (highlight)**

78% of the respondents felt that ongoing interaction with other students was important or extremely important.


**981 (highlight)**

understanding their diverse backgrounds, needs, and challenges;


**983 (highlight)**

staying in touch frequently via message boards, email, etc., and


**984 (highlight)**

being a beacon of encouragement, offering positive reinforcement and constructive feedback for improvement.


**994 (highlight)**

lack of support or indifference on a professor’s part significantly impacts their experience, regardless of the outcome of their studies.
