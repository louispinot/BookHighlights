Since the true price of electricity on the grid varies during any twenty-four-hour period, real-time information displayed on digital meters in every building would allow for dynamic pricing, letting consumers increase or decrease their energy use automatically, depending on price. Consumers who agree to slight adjustments in their electricity use will receive credits on their bills. Dynamic pricing also will let local energy producers know the best time to sell electricity back to the grid, or to go off the grid altogether.

Nabuurs sensed a change taking place in European power and utility companies—something not yet shared by their American counterparts. Intense discussions were taking place inside the corporate suites. These companies had been, for more than a century, attached at the hips to giant energy companies whom they relied on for the fossil fuels to generate electricity. A younger generation of executives, noticing a heightened interest from local municipalities, regions, small- and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives, and homeowners, in producing their own renewable electricity on micro-grids, saw an opportunity to recast the role of their companies. They envisioned power and utility companies adding a new function and, with it, a new business model to accompany their traditional role as suppliers of energy and managers of transmission and distribution. Why not use intelligent utility networks to better manage the existing flow of electrons coming from centralized fossil fuels and uranium fuel, while also using the distributed capability of the new smart grids to collect and transmit electrons coming in from thousands of on-site micro-grids? In other words, go from a unidirectional to a bidirectional management of electricity. In the new scenario, the companies would give up some of their traditional top-down control over both supply and transmission of electricity to become, at least partially, an integral part of an electricity network involving thousands of small energy producers. In the new scheme, the utility part of the power and utility companies becomes far more important. The company becomes the manager of an info-energy network. It moves increasingly away from selling its own energy to becoming a service provider, using its expertise to manage other people’s energy. By this new reasoning, utilities in the future will co-manage companies’ use of energy across their entire value chain, just as IT companies like IBM help businesses manage their information. The potential new business opportunities would eventually exceed their conventional business of simply selling electrons.

The most difficult aspect, from a management perspective, is the delicate process of phasing out of the old business model over a period of time—without killing it off prematurely—while also aggressively pursuing the new business model. This will test the management skills of the best and brightest among the younger generation of executives in the power and utility sector.

I was in Monaco to address an annual conference on cutting-edge Third Industrial Revolution technologies that brings together some of the world’s best minds in the tech sector with green entrepreneurs and financial institutions. The annual conference is the brainchild of Mungo Park, a savvy entrepreneur with a keen sense of the tech community and a talent for picking the likely winners among the thousands of green technologies competing for attention.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the average cost of winning a House race in 2008 was nearly $1.1 million. It cost almost $6.5 million to win a Senate seat. Presidential elections are even more expensive. The Center reported that more than $1.3 billion were spent by the candidates in the 2008 presidential election. How important are campaign funds to winning elections? According to a post-election analysis of the 2008 elections by the Center for Responsive Politics, in 94 percent of the Senate races and 93 percent of the House of Representatives races that had been decided within twenty-four hours after the polls closed, the highest-spending candidate won.

To their lasting credit, it is fair to say that the inventors, entrepreneurs, and financiers of the Second Industrial Revolution understood the system they were creating before the intellectual community could describe and categorize it, or government could properly regulate it. Although we think of entrepreneurship as isolated commercial accomplishments—in the form of new inventions or business ideas—the truly great entrepreneurial contributions are more systemic in nature. They occur when the business community comes to see how their individual commercial pursuits fit into a broader economic vision.

Today, we are witnessing the convergence of a new communications media and energy regime—a Third Industrial Revolution. Businesses across widely divergent fields—clean energies, green construction, telecommunications, micro-generation, distributed grid IT, plug-in electric and fuel cell transport, sustainable chemistry, nanotechnology, zero-carbon logistics and supply-chain management, and so on—are developing an array of new technologies, products, and services.


**2709 (highlight)**

Until recently, these new commercial opportunities have attracted only modest interest in the investment community and with the public at large. That’s because we human beings live by stories, and stories are always about the relationships and interactions between characters. Just as individual words don’t tell a tale, individual technologies, product lines, and services don’t make a new economic narrative. It’s when we discover how they all relate to each other and create a new economic conversation that heads start to turn.

We are moving from “globalization” to “continentalization.”

Now, as the EU enters its second half century, energy again has become central to the next stage of continental development.

on—it stands to reason that thermodynamic efficiency is central to the story of productivity


**4021 (highlight)**

We need to be continually reminded that whenever we increase the use of energy to accelerate the economic process, the productivity gains must be weighed against the increased entropy that flows into the environment.


**4025 (highlight)**

“Haste makes waste” is an age-old adage that reflects an intuitive understanding of the entropy law at work.


**4034 (highlight)**

This sobering situation calls for a fundamental reassessment of the assumptions that have guided our notions about productivity in the past. From here on, productivity is going to have to be measured in a way that takes into account both thermodynamic efficiencies as well as entropic consequences.

biomimicry—the idea of studying how nature operates and borrowing best practices—is becoming an increasingly fashionable pursuit in product research and development, economic modeling, and urban planning. We’d be well-served by studying how climax ecosystems balance their budgets, and applying the lessons to balancing our own budgets

The First Industrial Revolution quickened the production of goods beyond that of any previous period of history, allowing artisans and laborers to live better than the royalty of just a few centuries earlier. Caught up in the elation, Enlightenment economists began to extol the innate virtues of private property relations in the marketplace, and came to see the acquisition of property as an inherent biological drive, rather than a social proclivity conditioned by a specific communication/energy paradigm.


**4158 (highlight)**

The market mechanism became the “invisible hand” to regulate the supply and demand of private property and to assure that its distribution was as impartial as the laws of Newtonian physics that governed the universe. The pursuit of self-interest—also regarded as an innate quality of human nature—would guarantee a steady advance of the general welfare and move humankind along the road to unlimited progress. Concepts


**4163 (highlight)**

The emergent Third Industrial Revolution, however, brings with it a very different conception of human drives, and the assumptions that govern human economic activity. The distributed and collaborative nature of the new economic paradigm is forcing a fundamental rethinking of the high regard previously bestowed on private property relations in markets.


**4165 (highlight)**

The quickening connection of the nervous system of every human being to every other human being on Earth, via the Internet and other new communications technologies, is propelling us into a global social space and a new simultaneous field of time. The result is that access to vast global networks is becoming as important a value as private property rights were in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.


**4198 (highlight)**

The new conflicts in the biosphere era will increasingly center around access rights. The change reflects the diminishing importance of ownership relative to access in a globally connected and interdependent world.


**4235 (highlight)**

It’s unlikely that copyrights and patents will survive in their present form in a collaborative, open-source world where the right to universal access trumps the right to exclusive ownership.

reporter Mark Levine described the new mindset with the astute observation that “sharing is to ownership what the iPod is to the eight track, what the solar panel is to the coal mine. Sharing is clean, crisp, urbane, postmodern: owning is dull, selfish, timid, backward.”27


**4292 (highlight)**

In a near transaction-free economy, property still exists, but remains in the hands of the producer and is accessed by the consumer over a period of time. Why would anyone want to own anything in a world of continuous upgrades, where new product lines sweep in and out of the market in an instant?

White-collar and service industries are experiencing similar dramatic gains in productivity and shedding record numbers of workers in the process. Secretaries, file clerks, bookkeepers, telephone operators, and bank tellers are among the scores of traditional white-collar jobs that have become virtually extinct with the introduction of intelligent technology. The retail sector is in the midst of the same shift. Automatic checkout lines have replaced cashiers and automated shipping departments have replaced the need for human labor in the back room. Similarly, the travel industry is increasingly employing voice recognition technology that can converse with customers in real time and book travel and hotel accommodations without any need of human intervention. Even hospitals are making the transition to intelligent technology, with robots performing routine tasks ranging from simple surgeries and medical diagnostics to cleaning and maintenance. Intelligent technology is taking over a multitude of jobs once performed by human beings, from operating light rail and automated weapon systems to buying and selling on the stock exchange.


**5106 (highlight)**

The conundrum is that if productivity advances brought on by the application of intelligent technologies, robotics, and automation continue to push more and more workers to marginal employment or unemployment around the world, the diminishing purchasing power is likely to stifle further economic growth.


**5115 (highlight)**

put it another way, because we’re doubling the rate of progress every decade, we are likely to experience “the equivalent of a century of progress—at today’s rate—in only twenty-five calendar days.”


**5118 (highlight)**

Kurzweil and other scientists ask us to try and imagine what the effect on human society might be considering that before the end of the century our smart technology will be “trillions of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human intelligence.”


**5121 (highlight)**

The implications for human work—professional, technical, and vocational—are staggering. Just as the industrial age ended slave labor, the collaborative age is likely to end mass wage labor.


**5123 (highlight)**

While the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were characterized by mass labor operating machines, the twenty-first century is characterized by boutique, high-tech, professional workforces programming and monitoring intelligent technology systems.

**5128 (highlight)**

While the Third Industrial Revolution establishes the infrastructure for a transition into a distributed and collaborative era, signaling the end to the industrial age and the mass labor force that accompanied it, the laying down of the critical infrastructure over the course of the next forty years will require a final surge of mass labor power.

Even more interesting, the third sector is the fastest growing employment sector in many parts of the world. In France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK, the nonprofit sector accounted for 40 percent of total employment growth—or


**5200 (highlight)**

The reality, however, is that fees for services and products account for approximately 50 percent of the aggregate revenue in the third sector in the forty-two countries surveyed, while government support makes up 36 percent of the revenue and private philanthropy constitutes only 14 percent of the revenue.16


**5212 (highlight)**

The civil society is likely to become as significant a source of employment as the market sector by mid-century, for the simple reason that creating social capital relies on human interactivity, whereas creating market capital increasingly relies on intelligent technology.

For power and utility companies, not to mention banks and governments, which were used to gathering fossil fuels that were concentrated at limited sites, doing the same with renewable energies seemed to make sense. And big centralized solar parks and wind farms began popping up in scattered parts of Europe where those energies are abundant. Around 2006, however, some energy entrepreneurs, policy analysts, nongovernmental organizations, and politicians made a simple observation that inevitably led to a profound change in the discussion around a sustainable economic model. The sun shines on every part of the Earth every day, even if the intensity varies. The wind blows all over the world, even if the frequency is intermittent.

unlike fossil fuels and uranium, which are elite energies and only found in certain regions of the world, renewable energies are everywhere. This realization fundamentally changed the thinking of my colleagues. If renewable energies are distributed and found in various proportions and frequencies everywhere in the world, why would we want to collect them in only a few central points? We realized we were using outmoded twentieth-century ways of thinking about energy based on our previous experiences with fossil fuels.
