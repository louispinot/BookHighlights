#Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers

Having a product your early customers love but no clear way to get more traction is frustrating. To address this frustration, spend your time building product and testing traction channels – in parallel.


**262 (highlight)**

In other words, traction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention. This is what we call the 50% rule: spend 50% of your time on product and 50% on traction. This split is hard to do because the pull to spend all of your attention on product is strong, and splitting your time will certainly slow down product development. However, it won’t slow the time to get your product successfully to market.


**274 (highlight)**

waiting until you ship a product to embark on traction development usually results in one or more additional product development cycles as you adjust to real market feedback. That’s why doing traction and product development in parallel may slow down product development in the short run, but not in the long run.


**276 (highlight)**

The second benefit to parallel product and traction development is that you get to experiment and test different traction channels before you launch anything. This means when your product is ready, you can grow rapidly.

By using this content strategy, we at Marketo began drumming up interest in our solutions with so much advance notice we had a pipeline of more than 14,000 interested buyers when the product came to market.” Marketo wouldn’t have had 14,000 interested buyers if they just focused on product development. It’s the difference between significant customer growth on day one – real traction – and just a product you know some people want.

Bullseye works hand-in-hand with Lean. What Lean is to product development, Bullseye is to traction. With Lean, you figure out the right features to build. With Bullseye, you figure out the right traction channel to pursue.


**296 (highlight)**

You are much more likely to develop a good distribution strategy with a good traction development methodology (like Bullseye) the same way you are much more likely to develop a good product with a good product development methodology (like Lean). Both help address major risks that face early stage companies: market risk (that you can reach customers in a sustainable way) and product risk (that customers want what you’re building), respectively.

At different product phases, moving the needle means different things.


**346 (highlight)**

When you constantly test traction channels by sending through a steady stream of new users, you can tell how leaky your bucket is. You can also tell if it is getting less leaky over time, which it should be if your product development strategy is sound. In fact this is a great feedback loop between traction development and product development that you can use to make sure you’re on the right track.

Sustainable product engagement growth (i.e. more customers getting engaged over time) is hard for any investor to ignore.


**387 (highlight)**

If you are considering a pivot, the first thing to look for is evidence of real product engagement, even if it is only a few dedicated customers. If you have such engagement, you might be giving up too soon. You should examine these bright spots to see how they might be expanded. Why do these customers take to your product so well? Is there some thread that unites them? Are they early adopters in a huge market or are they outliers? The answers to these questions may reveal some promise that is not immediately evident in your core metrics.


**391 (note)**

this is great advice!!


**399 (highlight)**

Don’t fall into The Product Trap: pursue traction and product development in parallel, and spend equal time on both.


**402 (highlight)**

Focus on strategies and tactics that can plausibly move the needle for company. What change in growth metrics would move the needle for your company?


**430 (highlight)**

When trying to figure out what traction channel to focus on using Bullseye, you run cheap tests on the traction channels in your inner circle. The goal of these tests is to validate or invalidate assumptions you have about strategies in these traction channels. For example: How much does it cost to acquire customers through this channel strategy? How many customers are available through this channel strategy? How well do these customers convert? How long does it take to acquire a customer? These are the assumptions to plug into your model (usually a spreadsheet) that will determine which channel and strategies to focus on.


**439 (highlight)**

Once you know your assumptions, devise specific tests to validate them as cheaply as possible. These first tests in a channel are often very cheap: for instance, if you spend just $250 on AdWords, you’ll get a rough idea of how well the search engine marketing channel works for your business. With limited resources, it’s almost impossible to optimize multiple strategies at once. Running ten social ads and testing everything about them (ad copy, landing pages, etc.) is a full-time endeavor. That is optimization, not testing. Rather, you should be running several cheap tests (perhaps two social ads with two landing pages) that give some indication of how successful a given channel or channel strategy could be.

Really focusing on a channel takes significant time and resources. This time is valuable and should only be used after you have some indication that a given traction channel or strategy within it will likely work.


**447 (highlight)**

“The faster you run high quality experiments, the more likely you’ll find scalable, effective growth tactics. Determining the success of a customer acquisition idea is dependent on an effective tracking and reporting system, so don’t start testing until your tracking/reporting system has been implemented.”


**449 (note)**

so if you need traction from the start you need analytics from the start


**453 (highlight)**

After you’ve run cheap tests, validated assumptions, and found a traction channel that is working, your goal is optimize your use of that channel. A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a tactic that helps you do just that.


**461 (highlight)**

Making A/B testing a habit (even if you just run 1 test a week) will improve your efficiency in a traction channel by 2–3x. There are many tools to help you do this type of testing, such as Optimizely, Visual Website Optimizer, and Unbounce.


**476 (highlight)**

– there are some quantitative metrics that are universal across traction channels. We recommend using a spreadsheet to help you rank and prioritize your traction channels. At a minimum, include the columns of cost to acquire a customer and lifetime value of a customer within a given traction channel. Since these metrics are universal, you can use them to easily make comparisons across channels. In general, we encourage you to be as quantitative as possible, even if it is initially just guesstimating.


**487 (highlight)**

Quantifying the number of users you might add becomes even more important in phase II and phase III when you already have product-market fit. In that case most channels will give you some users, and so they are all tempting to some degree. The operative question then is, “Does this channel have enough users to be meaningful?” A back-of-the-envelope calculation can go a long way!

You should always have a traction goal you’re working towards. This could be 1,000 paying customers, 100 new daily users, or 10% of your market.

You should always have a traction goal you’re working towards. This could be 1,000 paying customers, 100 new daily users, or 10% of your market. The right goal is highly dependent on your business. It should be chosen carefully and align with your company strategy. If you reach this goal, what will change significantly? Perhaps you’d be profitable, be able to raise money more easily, or become the market leader.
