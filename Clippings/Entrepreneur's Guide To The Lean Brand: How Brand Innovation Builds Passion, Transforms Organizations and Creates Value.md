testing a Minimum Viable Brand (MVB). If an element in your MVB works, keep it and prepare it for scale. If it falls flat, iterate and test again.


**1008 (highlight)**

A Minimum Viable Brand (MVB) gives a starting point for your intentional brand development by distilling your brand down to the most critical elements—story, artifact, and invitation.


**1013 (highlight)**

keep in mind that each of the components are meant to be prompts to inspire the development of the overall relationship


**1014 (note)**

du coup, que leur dirais je a mes prospects si j les renvontrai en vrai? comment je leur raconterais mon histoire et les inviterais a me suivre ?


**1025 (highlight)**

Story is the scaffolding for your relationship with your audience. You want people to hear your story and be compelled to become part of it, have a deep emotional connection to it, and share it as if it were their own. The story gives voice to who you are as founders, who you are as a startup, why that matters, and what kind of organization you want to build.


**1036 (highlight)**

Invitations are the mechanisms to ask people to join you on a journey toward shared value. Invitations are much more than simple marketing messages. The context, medium, content, and structure of how you invite someone to join are all important.


**1054 (highlight)**

How will you measure to know if you are gaining validated learning?


**1055 (highlight)**

What do you need to build to run an experiment


**1057 (highlight)**

should) be embarrassed by your first MVB. Don’t get stuck on the details.


**1057 (highlight)**

Don’t get stuck on the details.


**1058 (highlight)**

Instead of focusing on polish, your efforts should focus on helping your customers believe that you comprehend who they are and care about their relationship


**1061 (highlight)**

initial interaction point.


**1070 (highlight)**

In fact, their first experiment will more than likely be to track how many people download their poster, print it out, fill in their name, and take a photo of it to share on Facebook.


**1071 (note)**

there is a qualitative difference between the emotional reaction you hope to create and the very down to earth way you expect to verify it. or at least the feedback i expect is not only qualitative


**1071 (note)**

there is a qualitative difference between the emotional reaction you hope to create and the very down to earth way you expect to verify it


**1077 (highlight)**

As customers interact with your MVB, they will generate both qualitative feedback (for example, where they connect and where they don’t) and quantitative


**1084 (highlight)**

The final action in the loop is to learn from the data generated and validate or invalidate the emotional-value hypothesis along with the pieces of your brand that are working and iterate the pieces that aren’t.


**1093 (highlight)**

Chapter 8 and Chapter 9, we will dive into the emotional-value metrics of interaction, engagement, and participation to understand how to measure within the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.


**1099 (highlight)**

you must expand your thinking about product-market fit to include the emotional-value you’re creating through the relationships people are forming with you.


**1126 (highlight)**

growth hypothesis has to test how to create external demand to grow the depth and scope of relationships with your audience without adversely affecting existing value.


**1136 (highlight)**

Through their Lean Brand work, they knew how they created value for their audience, which was demonstrated by the continuous and growing passion they received from the food blogging community.


**1168 (highlight)**

search of the right relationships with the right audience.


**1184 (highlight)**

Stories are powerful.


**1189 (highlight)**

Story is the first piece of your Minimum Viable Brand. It is the backbone of any relationship because it has the ability to engage, delight, and relate to an audience in a way that nothing else really can.


**1194 (note)**

code= un moyen au servuce de tant d aspirations possibles


**1194 (highlight)**

Aspiration is our strongest driver of behavior. It is the drive to fulfill our dreams and to live a deeper life.


**1194 (highlight)**

Aspiration is our strongest driver of behavior.


**1195 (highlight)**

By engaging a person’s aspiration with your story, you invite others to be passionate about you. Nike engages our aspiration to be a better athlete, and athletes are passionate about wearing Nike products.


**1197 (note)**

ca c'est clé! leur raconte mon histoire, les encourager a en faire a leur et leur montrer cmt je vais les y aider


**1203 (highlight)**

You want to be urgent. You want to be the thing people hear about and think, “I will get this one next.”


**1206 (highlight)**

“Humans simply aren’t moved to action by ‘data dumps,’ dense PowerPoint slides, or spreadsheets packed with figures. People are moved by emotion.


**1210 (highlight)**

What’s the first thing you do when you meet someone new? You ask them to tell you their story. You ask them where they’re from and what they do. You ask them about their family and their friends. You ask them what makes them laugh and what their aspirations are.


**1210 (highlight)**

WHAT’S YOUR STORY? (YOUR “ONCE UPON A TIME”)


**1212 (note)**

remember this


**1220 (highlight)**

there are two pieces that are vital to your Lean Brand work—the founder story and the startup story.


**1227 (highlight)**

The point is to be authentic in telling the audience what purpose drives you, and intentional about how that story is communicated.


**1228 (highlight)**

Ask yourself, Why are you here? What got you here? Why you are the one to do what you’re doing? Do you want to change the world? Do you want to make your former classmates jealous?


**1238 (highlight)**

the best stories start with you as a customer with a need, not you as someone who’s hoping to profit from filling that need.


**1239 (note)**

**1239 (highlight)**

It’s not enough to simply say, “I always wanted to run a bagel shop,” or, “Since I was young, I’ve been passionate about starting my own tech company.” These types of stories fail to connect to anyone.


**1239 (note)**

**1247 (highlight)**

As customers begin forming a relationship with the startup itself, your story must evolve into a collective startup story. Naturally, events will build, milestones will pass, and your startup will take on a life of its own.


**1249 (highlight)**

Is your startup story a tale of David vs. Goliath? Or is it an idealistic narrative of a better future? Is it about adventure on the high seas of technology


**1253 (highlight)**

It starts with your aspirations as a startup.


**1253 (note)**

que tout e monde soit developpeur -> personal empowerment + eco +optimisme collectif et personnella vision est une matruce a 2 axes : peronnel/collectif +materiel/spirituel


**1254 (highlight)**

what you aspire to change, solve, or do and why that impacts your audience.


**1255 (highlight)**

about why your organization exists and what you aspire to become.


**1256 (highlight)**

those invested in the success of your organization must understand the startup’s unique and authentic story;


**1257 (highlight)**

What detail will you lead with? What should you emphasize? What will you leave out?


**1263 (highlight)**

Instead, relationships come from inviting them to something much bigger.


**1265 (highlight)**

your customer’s ability to see themselves in it, is the reason people will become passionate about you.


**1265 (note)**

how do i make them participate, be a part o that story in more ways than just the beneficiary of my mission?


**1276 (highlight)**

providing room for people to see themselves as a part of it are crucial to your brand-formation. Sharing the struggles, wins, challenges, ups, downs, rights, lefts, bumps, bruises, and victories is more important now than it ever was before.


**1285 (highlight)**

communicate your aspirations in an authentic, real, and relatable way.


**1290 (highlight)**

“Stories don’t create our beliefs. Rather, their themes are like magnets that find and attach themselves to beliefs that already exist.


**1291 (note)**

the goal is definitely not to creare an opinion in people but to strike a chord hard in people who have this opinion


**1293 (highlight)**

your founder story and your startup story are driving forces behind your MVB. They are the foundations upon which both your artifacts and your invitations are built.


**1297 (highlight)**

you must establish a rally point for your customers to begin to see how they fit.


**1308 (highlight)**

People aren’t inspired when they’re told, “At ABC Corp, our vision is to make the best widgets in the world, provide gold standard service to our customers, and to become the global leader in the widget industry.” The immediate following thought has to be, “As opposed to what? Making terrible widgets while providing second-rate service?”


**1311 (note)**

LOL


**1320 (highlight)**

These types of statements, although pretty, fail to inspire customers by mistaking appealing language for actual depth.


**1339 (highlight)**

In truth, a vision statement is just a collection of nice-sounding words that never create connection with your customers and will never express the depth of who you really are.


**1356 (highlight)**

feature bubble is an over-emphasis in talking about features not really justified by what will actually matter to your customers.


**1356 (note)**

for me that would be focusing to much on the pedagogy i enviion


**1360 (highlight)**

WHY they exist, then HOW they go about doing what they do, and then finally, WHAT they do.


**1361 (note)**

xa peut faire une bne trame pr la landing page


**1362 (highlight)**

In your customer’s mind it’s the WHY first, the product benefits (i.e. HOW the product benefits them) and features (WHAT creates the benefit) second.


**1365 (highlight)**

Your WHY represents the emotional impact your company has on an individual


**1369 (highlight)**

Your WHY as a founder results in your startup, and your startup’s WHY results in your products, your brand, and your culture.


**1375 (highlight)**

Maybe you exist to inspire people to make a change in their life .


**1375 (note)**

maybs!


**1389 (highlight)**

That the app will improve the practice routine is the functional utility. The aspiration that the kids will love music is WHY the startup exists and WHY the parents buy the product. Because the founder is a musician and understands the joy of music is WHY he committed to this particular business.


**1445 (highlight)**

You just can’t cut through the noise with a beautiful design or a feature rich product and expect it to be meaningful and create value for people.


**1454 (highlight)**

One simple exercise we went through was actually one of the hardest. We had to describe Zesty without mentioning a feature or a function. It sounds simple, but it was challenging.


**1471 (highlight)**

What could we say or do to get someone to light up about collaboration? What aligns with that story?”


**1471 (highlight)**

We had to really reevaluate our startup by asking ourselves, “Which features really communicate collaboration?


**1477 (highlight)**

You can’t argue with purpose. They can’t say, “That’s not why you built it.” Well, how do they know? We have an impression of how we think it will work for them and they have their impression of how well they think we did with it. But the point is that it’s something that connects with them, and then the rest falls in line.


**1487 (highlight)**

Working from your WHY, you can begin to shape your story around a common place where the pieces of who you are as an organization, who you are as a founder, and who your audience is can coalesce. Think about this space as a rally point.


**1490 (highlight)**

It will represent your ‘side’ and also dictate everything else that doesn’t fit to be on the other ‘side.’


**1490 (note)**

wow c'est tres "agressif" comme attitude


**1491 (note)**

demander a yann s'il comprend pk on existe


**1491 (highlight)**

Organizations should have a reason to exist.


**1506 (note)**

that means i have to start exerienting on   much larger group of students


**1506 (highlight)**

Understanding who is most passionate about you and what you stand for is the key to creating traction for your startup.


**1507 (highlight)**

You must work to build trust over time with this group of people by consistently adding value to ongoing conversations, establishing your rally point, and creating a depth of relationship your customers can only get from you.


**1508 (note)**

les aider en personne


**1512 (highlight)**

where the market is known


**1523 (highlight)**

If you stand for nothing, you will almost certainly fail to develop strong relationships with your audience. Stand for something, and stand by it. If you’re a musician fighting to help kids fall in love with music, stand by it. If you’re designers fighting to help people get in touch with their artistic side, stand by it. If you’re an action sports junkie fighting to help other people tell their story through video, stand by it. Identify and define your rally point unapologetically.


**1527 (note)**

moi je suis un jeunemec qui veux que tout le monde apprenne a coder


**1538 (highlight)**

The greatest startups focus on being great at a very small number of things. If you are to succeed as a startup, you have to pick those few ideals where you want to absolutely excel and shoot for the stars on those while ignoring the rest.


**1540 (note)**

"ideals" est le mot important


**1574 (highlight)**

artifacts are memory triggers.


**1576 (highlight)**

They turn abstract meaning into evident cues, allowing consumers to better identify


**1580 (highlight)**

But a successful brand is rarely about artifacts alone. Artifacts simply help your audience identify your company, shape expectations, and leave lasting impressions.


**1583 (highlight)**

artifact. Collectively they form a recognizable memory structure helping to reinforce the relationship a customer has with an organization.


**1597 (highlight)**

pivotal question a startup needs to ask is, “What do we think is the one crucial memory structure we need to establish with early adopters?” In other words, what is the minimum set of artifacts required so that our early adopters will connect with the value we’ve brought to them?


**1601 (highlight)**

The most effective artifacts should enhance your audience’s understanding of your startup while having an emotional impact.


**1621 (highlight)**

The truth is, as a startup founder, you don’t know which artifacts you need and which you don’t, which will be effective and which will not, or which artifacts are crucial to building a memory structure and which will be ineffective. As long as you don’t know the value you’re creating and for whom, based on transactions in the marketplace, how could you know how to represent that value?


**1642 (highlight)**

They have developed a passionate and devoted audience (which they lovingly refer to as “Model Citizens”)


**1693 (highlight)**

In the beginning, it was a celebration of smallness and candid spirit and ambition that won us a lot of followers at that time. It was just an honest recognition of where we were, and where we wanted to go was something that was so beyond impossible, it didn’t make anyone feel like we were thinking we were larger than life. We were very clearly incredibly small, but people appreciated an enthusiastic and hyperbolic vision of being successful.


**1697 (highlight)**

We are always reaching the point of being obnoxiously ambitious to then bring it back to joking around.


**1705 (highlight)**

If you give your audience a platform from which to tell the story and you make sure they feel their effort is deeply rewarded for being the star, they really connect with you.


**1722 (highlight)**

It’s also fun to build up an audience that way


**1742 (highlight)**

I had to work harder in the beginning when the audience was just a handful of people, but it has always been the same consistent story.


**1744 (highlight)**

Then people wanted to play ball with us.


**1762 (highlight)**

Focus on “high altitude” attributes that are magnetic to your customer and your team. Big, emotional ideas—


**1817 (highlight)**

to focus your efforts around the creation of dynamic artifacts.


**2290 (highlight)**

To be successful in the value-creation economy you must discover the value you are creating and for whom that value is being created.


**2292 (highlight)**

Value is not realized in brilliant assumptions, genius strategies, or creative ideas alone, but instead occurs where creative inspiration meets the rigor of validation.


**2330 (highlight)**

Emotional-value describes the relational bias or preference we have for one product over another, and, more importantly, one company over another.


**2331 (note)**

c'est sur ce terrain qu'on doit gagner


**234 (highlight)**

the relationship between “brands” and customers has changed dramatically as the channel has changed from one-direction to multi-directional.


**247 (highlight)**

purposeful branding requires a deliberate effort to establish an ongoing relationship with customers based upon providing value.


**248 (highlight)**

brand must represent the achievable promise


**249 (highlight)**

plus the shared aspiration you have with your customer to achieve change.


**258 (highlight)**

“lean branding” is about eliminating the waste of building a brand that no one wants a relationship with.


**334 (highlight)**

a brand is a relationship because it’s how we, as humans, intuitively relate to products, organizations, and ideas.


**347 (highlight)**

That connection happens at the junction of who you (as the organization) are and who your audience (customers, employees, evangelists) aspires to be.


**349 (highlight)**

see the relationship you form with your audience as the synchronicity between who you are and who your audience wants to become.


**360 (highlight)**

Intentional Branding is the deliberate and conscious activities taken by an organization to project its value for the purpose of building the relationship with its audience.


**364 (highlight)**

There are three phases of development: brand-formation, brand-growth, and brand-management.


**369 (highlight)**

A Lean Brand is a brand wherein an organization and audience have achieved a symbiotic relationship around common value without any extraneous activities.


**386 (highlight)**




**393 (highlight)**

allows you to understand the emotional nature of a brand. Relationships are with people; and people are sensitive, perceptive beings who develop deep feelings about who you are and why you matter.


**415 (highlight)**

Step one is developing a target and getting to know


**443 (highlight)**

To practice brand innovation, you must be open to the unknown, understand how to fail quickly, and value agile movement.


**453 (highlight)**

product is an outcome of a much larger story. There’s the team behind the product, the problem the product is trying to solve, the narrative of how the product came into existence.


**460 (highlight)**

Products can be brands.


**461 (highlight)**

Their value grows exponentially when connected to something larger than just the product itself.


**479 (highlight)**

your brand is much more than a marketing strategy. It’s a way of life for your organization


**484 (highlight)**

development. No matter what you believe about your ability as a creative,


**485 (highlight)**

Your brand is about you. About your story and the unique attributes that make you who you are. No one else can tell that story but you.


**514 (highlight)**

mistrust. People feel the inauthenticity of an organization attempting to act like something that it isn’t and will reject those things


**521 (highlight)**

can be excellent at creating visual artifacts that point back to your brand . . . but they do not create brands. They simply reflect them.


**537 (highlight)**

In the Social Age value is created though connected individuals. Passionate individuals are connecting around ideas which in turn are driving the creation of new businesses that are based on trust, authenticity and purpose.”


**549 (highlight)**

Through the organization of crowds, individual groups of people (not big institutions) are dominating the production of value throughout the world.


**606 (highlight)**

Although no two brands are the same, all face the same challenge—deliver value or fail. Value is only discovered through experimentation, iteration, and innovation.


**617 (highlight)**

draw from multiple places of learning to create depth, validity, and strength in the relationship you are building.


**619 (highlight)**

Brand development is characterized by expansion and exploration in multiple directions.


**645 (highlight)**

We must stop relying on deliverables to do the relationship building for us and embrace the pursuit of discovering shared value.


**689 (highlight)**

if you can’t articulate what value you offer that no one else can, you don’t have a grasp on what your brand is and the potential it has to offer.


**718 (highlight)**

The first one was just a two-page website. A landing page and then you would click “Sign up,” and it would take you to a page that said, “We’re not quite ready yet, but give us your email, and I’d love to let you know when we are ready to launch.” That was great because the first page made it look like the product actually existed. So, I got a lot of validation because the only way to get to that page was to actually click “Sign up.” After the first test, I had a lot of conversations with people via e-mail, then a couple of Skype calls,


**723 (highlight)**

The second test was whether or not people would actually pay. So I reworked the website’s flow to be: landing page to “Pricing and Plans” button and then to an actual pricing page with three plans—free, $5/month, and $20/month. People would then have to pick one of those plans to end up on the page that said, “We’re not quite ready yet.” We had lots of conversations resulting from that test as well. I collected 120 emails in those seven weeks, and on the first day of launch about 50 people signed up. These are not huge numbers, but it was kind of working.


**739 (highlight)**

continued that very personal communication style.


**741 (highlight)**

I was really intrigued, and I wanted to learn who these people were and what was the key value they were finding in Buffer and why they wanted to pay. I would always just click through to their Twitter or their email address and click through to their website just to see what each person was all about.


**745 (highlight)**

I just casually mentioned that photo in the email I sent him and said, “Welcome to the paid plan. I saw your photography, and I really loved this photo.”


**754 (highlight)**

That’s been a key part for us and it has helped us, we get so much feedback, and people really love that. If you search Twitter at any point for Buffer, generally you will find people that are really happy with the service and raving about it. I think that helps our brand overall.


**757 (highlight)**

“PS You Can Reply to This Email,”


**768 (highlight)**

Speed, agility, and adaptability are key to building a successful brand today.


**769 (highlight)**

The opportunity cost of focusing on the wrong things in branding is high.


**773 (highlight)**

Facilitating, measuring, and understanding these reactions are the basis for discovering and creating value with your brand development.


**773 (highlight)**

you should focus on how your customers react to your intentional branding and how your customers relate to you. Facilitating, measuring, and understanding these reactions are the basis for discovering and creating value with your brand development.


**782 (highlight)**

everything you do within the framework has to be measurable, you will understand quickly what works and what falls flat.


**783 (highlight)**

focus on your strongest emotional-value offering first.


**786 (highlight)**

diagnose and repair parts of your brand development that aren’t working and accelerate parts that are working.


**932 (highlight)**

Brand development begins with assumptions about who you are, why you will matter, what people desire, like, think, believe, want, and ultimately will become passionate about.


**935 (highlight)**

You will know you’ve crossed the hypothesis gap when you’re able to first test your ideas with an initial audience to generate feedback.


**943 (highlight)**

2) Why do we think it matters? Why do we think people will care?


**944 (highlight)**

3) Who do we think will be most passionate about our story?


**945 (highlight)**

Once you’ve generated as many ideas as you can, you will move on to idea synthesis


**945 (highlight)**

Idea synthesis is the comparison of these ideas against one another to form a set of assumptions. You’ll want to compare and contrast your ideas against one


**947 (highlight)**

decide which assumptions to test.


**950 (highlight)**

There are two essential assumptions every startup has to make: the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis.


**954 (highlight)**

your value hypothesis must expand to include your leap of faith assumption about the emotional-value you will create.


**957 (highlight)**

The functional-value hypothesis describes the value created in solving a problem for your customers. The emotional-value hypothesis describes the value created in the relationship your customers will form with you (for example, helping your customers reach their aspirations, customers becoming passionate about you, and the impact solving the problem has on the customers’ lives.).


**962 (highlight)**

you may choose to integrate them into one.


**969 (highlight)**

it may make more sense to test the emotional-value hypothesis independent from the functional-value hypothesis. Although overlap always exists between the two, the functionality of the product and the branding elements may need independent measurements to be accurate and generate learnings from which to build.


**972 (note)**

i think this is totally the case for my e-bootcamp project


**975 (highlight)**

It’s best to actually write your hypothesis down so you can refer to it and iterate on it later down the development line. You can use a structure like this: We believe [this set of people] will [care / be passionate about us] for / because [this reason].


**985 (highlight)**

Where will people “light up” when they learn about their startup? They distilled their ideas about these types of questions down to one critical assumption—that their fight to make design simple, accessible, and cost-effective meant a world where every idea can be beautifully presented and where people will feel more connected to an artistic part of themselves.


**992 (highlight)**

Not only does this hypothesis get beyond the functionality of Pixelriffic, but it gets to the heart of what makes them unique:


**993 (highlight)**

If people connect with them here, they have a good shot of building a strong relationship with a core audience.
