These neocortical patterns are the language of thought. Just like language, they are hierarchical, but they are not language per se. Our thoughts are not conceived primarily in the elements of language, although since language also exists as hierarchies of patterns in our neocortex, we can have language-based thoughts. But for the most part, thoughts are represented in these neocortical patterns.

is fair to say that our emotional experiences take place in both the old and the new brains. Thinking takes place in the new brain (the neocortex), but feeling takes place in both. Any emulation of human behavior will therefore need to model both. However, if it is just human cognitive intelligence that we are after, the neocortex is sufficient.

It is fair to say that our emotional experiences take place in both the old and the new brains. Thinking takes place in the new brain (the neocortex), but feeling takes place in both. Any emulation of human behavior will therefore need to model both. However, if it is just human cognitive intelligence that we are after, the neocortex is sufficient. We can replace the old brain with the more direct motivation of a nonbiological neocortex to achieve the goals that we assign to it. For example, in the case of Watson, the goal was simply stated: Come up with correct answers to Jeopardy! queries (albeit these were further modulated by a program that understood Jeopardy! wagering). In the case of the new Watson system being jointly developed by Nuance and IBM for medical knowledge, the goal is to help treat human disease. Future systems can have goals such as actually curing disease and alleviating poverty. A lot of the pleasure-fear struggle is already obsolete for humans, as the old brain evolved long before even primitive human society got started; indeed most of it is reptilian.

Spindle cells have long neural filaments called apical dendrites, which are able to connect to faraway neocortical regions. Such “deep” interconnectedness, in which certain neurons provide connections across numerous regions, is a feature that occurs increasingly as we go up the evolutionary ladder. It is not surprising that the spindle cells, involved as they are in handling emotion and moral judgment, would have this form of connectedness, given the ability of higher-level emotional reactions to touch on diverse topics and thoughts. Because of their links to many other parts of the brain, the high-level emotions that spindle cells process are affected by all of our perceptual and cognitive regions. It is important to point out that these cells are not doing rational problem solving, which is why we don’t have rational control over our responses to music or over falling in love. The rest of the brain is heavily engaged, however, in trying to make sense of our mysterious high-level emotions.

A technique I have used in my own work to combat increasing specialization is to assemble the experts that I have gathered for a project (for example, my speech recognition work included speech scientists, linguists, psychoacousticians, and pattern recognition experts, not to mention computer scientists) and encourage each one to teach the group his particular techniques and terminology. We then throw out all of that terminology and make up our own. Invariably we find metaphors from one field that solve problems in another.

one way to achieve greater creativity is by effectively assembling more neocortex. One approach to expand the available neocortex is through the collaboration of multiple humans. This is accomplished routinely via the communication between people gathered in a problem-solving community. Recently there have been efforts to use online collaboration tools to harness the power of real-time collaboration, which have shown success in mathematics and other fields.1 The next step, of course, will be to expand the neocortex itself with its nonbiological equivalent. This will be our ultimate act of creativity: to create the capability of being creative. A nonbiological neocortex will ultimately be faster and could rapidly search for the kinds of metaphors that inspired Darwin and Einstein. It could systematically explore all of the overlapping boundaries between our exponentially expanding frontiers of knowledge. Some people express concern about what will happen to those who would opt out of such mind expansion. I would point out that this additional intelligence will essentially reside in the cloud (the exponentially expanding network of computers that we connect to through online communication), where most of our machine intelligence is now stored. When you use a search engine, recognize speech from your phone, consult a virtual assistant such as Siri, or use your phone to translate a sign into another language, the intelligence is not in the device itself but in the cloud. Our expanded neocortex will be housed there too. Whether we access such expanded intelligence through direct neural connection or the way we do now—by interacting with it via our devices—is an arbitrary distinction. In my view we will all become more creative through this pervasive enhancement, whether we choose to opt in or out of direct connection to humanity’s expanded intelligence. We have already outsourced much of our personal, social, historical, and cultural memory to the cloud, and we will ultimately do the same thing with our hierarchical thinking.

From an evolutionary perspective, love itself exists to meet the needs of the neocortex. If we didn’t have a neocortex, then lust would be quite sufficient to guarantee reproduction. The ecstatic instigation of love leads to attachment and mature love, and results in a lasting bond. This in turn is designed to provide at least the possibility of a stable environment for children while their own neocortices undergo the critical learning needed to become responsible and capable adults. Learning in a rich environment is inherently part of the method of the neocortex. Indeed the same oxytocin and vasopressin hormone mechanisms play a key role in establishing the critical bonding of parent (especially mother) and child.

A mother rat will build a nest for her young even if she has never seen another rat in her lifetime.1 Similarly, a spider will spin a web, a caterpillar will create her own cocoon, and a beaver will build a dam, even if no contemporary ever showed them how to accomplish these complex tasks. That is not to say that these are not learned behaviors. It is just that these animals did not learn them in a single lifetime—they learned them over thousands of lifetimes. The evolution of animal behavior does constitute a learning process, but it is learning by the species, not by the individual, and the fruits of this learning process are encoded in DNA. To appreciate the significance of the evolution of the neocortex, consider that it greatly sped up the process of learning (hierarchical knowledge) from thousands of years to months (or less). Even if millions of animals in a particular mammalian species failed to solve a problem (requiring a hierarchy of steps), it required only one to accidentally stumble upon a solution. That new method would then be copied and spread exponentially through the population. We are now in a position to

One controversy concerning Markram’s work is how to verify that the simulations are accurate. In order to do this, these simulations will need to demonstrate learning that I discuss below. He projects simulating an entire rat brain of 100 mesocircuits, totaling 100 million neurons and about a trillion synapses, by 2014. In a talk at the 2009 TED conference at Oxford, Markram said, “It is not impossible to build a human brain, and we can do it in 10 years.”3 His most recent target for a full brain simulation is 2023.4

My core thesis, which I call the law of accelerating returns (LOAR), is that fundamental measures of information technology follow predictable and exponential trajectories, belying the conventional wisdom that “you can’t predict the future.”

Once a technology becomes an information technology, it becomes subject to the LOAR.

For a modern perspective, the recent book Abundance (2012), by X-Prize Foundation founder (and cofounder with me of Singularity University) Peter Diamandis and science writer Steven Kotler, documents the extraordinary ways in which life today has steadily improved in every dimension.

The “cell phone” (the term is placed in quotes because it is vastly more than a phone) in my pocket is a million times less expensive yet thousands of times more powerful than the computer all the students and professors at MIT shared when I was an undergraduate there. That’s a several billion-fold increase in price/performance over the last forty years, an escalation we will see again in the next twenty-five years, when what used to fit in a building, and now fits in your pocket, will fit inside a blood cell.

Whether we are able to surpass or otherwise get around the speed of light as a limit will be the key strategic issue for the human-machine civilization at the beginning of the twenty-second century.
